*VARMon* is a text-based tool to monitor DAC 960/1100 based RAID controllers.

## History
As the Debian maintainer of *VARMon*, I wrote several patches for it.
Dragan Stanvecic, the original author did not want to continue maintenance of *VARMon*,
therefore I took over its maintenance in 2004.

## Download

You can grab it from the
[Git](https://github.com/jd/varmon) repository.
