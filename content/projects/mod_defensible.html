*mod_defensible* is an Apache 2.x module intended to block spammers using DNSBL servers.


It will look at the client IP and check it in one or several DNSBL servers and return
a 403 Forbidden page to the client.

# Download

You can download it from [the Git
repository](https://github.com/jd/mod_defensible).

# Installation

{% syntax bash %}
./configure
make
su -
make install
{% endsyntax %}

You can use =--with-udns= to enable [udns](http://www.corpit.ru/mjt/udns.html)
(asynchronous resolver library) usage, which should be faster.

However, this is not mandatory.

{% syntax apache %}
# Configuration
# Activate DNSBL usage
DnsblUse On
# Specify DNSBL servers
DnsblServers xbl-sbl.spamhaus.org. mydnsbl.server.org.
{% endsyntax %}

With udns support, you can also use:

{% syntax apache %}
# Specify another nameserver to use instead of default system resolver
DnsblNameserver 192.168.3.254
{% endsyntax %}

# Why?

mod_ **d** efe **ns** i **bl** e

{% endfilter %}
