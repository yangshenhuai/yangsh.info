Apache 2.4 being out, I noticed that my good old
[mod_defensible](http://julien.danjou.info/software/mod_defensible) did not
compile anymore.

The [changes in the new Apache 2.4
API](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/developer/new_api_2_4.html) were small
for its concern, so it was pretty easy to update this software to make it
compile again.

Honestly, I'm not sure that this module is really used into the wild, but I
still think that it can serve as a good prototype for doing other things so
I like keeping it around. :-)

All this has been triggered by the Apache 2.4 arrival into Debian
experimental. Therefore [I've updated the mod_defensible package to use the
new
dh_apache2](http://git.naquadah.org/?p=mod_defensible.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/debian/unstable),
and imported it into Git at the same time.
