It took a while to get it out, but finally, 3 years after the latest release
(1.2), the version of 1.3 of [xpyb](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xcb/xpyb/)
(the [XCB](http://xcb.freedesktop.org) Python bindngs) is out.

This version has a lot of improvement, and major bug fixes (memory
corruption and memory leak were tracked down and fixed).

One amazing feature that is now shipped with that release, is [my code to
export the xpyb API to other Python
modules](http://julien.danjou.info/blog/2009/python-cairo-and-xcb-support),
allowing to draw with [Pycairo](http://www.cairographics.org/pycairo/) in
Python using XCB.

Here is an example of a Python program that draws a spiral in a window using
xpyb and Pycairo. You need xpyb >= 1.3 and Pycairo >= 1.10 to make this
works.

{% syntax python %}
import cairo
import xcb
from xcb.xproto import *

WIDTH, HEIGHT = 600, 600

def draw_spiral(ctx, width, height):
    """Draw a spiral with lines!"""
    wd = .02 * width
    hd = .02 * height

    width -= 2
    height -= 2

    ctx.move_to (width + 1, 1-hd)
    for i in range(9):
        ctx.rel_line_to (0, height - hd * (2 * i - 1))
        ctx.rel_line_to (- (width - wd * (2 *i)), 0)
        ctx.rel_line_to (0, - (height - hd * (2*i)))
        ctx.rel_line_to (width - wd * (2 * i + 1), 0)

    ctx.set_source_rgb (0, 0, 1)
    ctx.stroke()

# Connect to the X server
conn = xcb.connect()
# Get the X server setup
setup = conn.get_setup()
# Generate X ID for our X "objects"
window = conn.generate_id()
pixmap = conn.generate_id()
gc = conn.generate_id()
# Create a new window
conn.core.CreateWindow(setup.roots[0].root_depth, window,
                       # Parent is the root window
                       setup.roots[0].root,
                       0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT, 0, WindowClass.InputOutput,
                       setup.roots[0].root_visual,
                       CW.BackPixel | CW.EventMask,
                       [ setup.roots[0].white_pixel, EventMask.ButtonPress | EventMask.EnterWindow | EventMask.LeaveWindow | EventMask.Exposure ])

# Create a pixmap: it will be used to draw with cairo
conn.core.CreatePixmap(setup.roots[0].root_depth, pixmap, setup.roots[0].root,
                       WIDTH, HEIGHT)

# We just need a GC to copy later the pixmap on the window, so create one
# very simple
conn.core.CreateGC(gc, setup.roots[0].root, GC.Foreground | GC.Background,
                   [ setup.roots[0].black_pixel, setup.roots[0].white_pixel ])

# Create a cairo surface
surface = cairo.XCBSurface (conn, pixmap,
                            setup.roots[0].allowed_depths[0].visuals[0], WIDTH, HEIGHT)
# Create a cairo context with that surface
ctx = cairo.Context(surface)

# Paint everything in white
ctx.set_source_rgb (1, 1, 1)
ctx.set_operator (cairo.OPERATOR_SOURCE)
ctx.paint()

# Draw our spiral
draw_spiral (ctx, WIDTH, HEIGHT)

# Map the window on the screen so it gets visible
conn.core.MapWindow(window)

# Flush all X requests to the X server
conn.flush()

while True:
    try:
        event = conn.wait_for_event()
    except xcb.ProtocolException, error:
        print "Protocol error %s received!" % error.__class__.__name__
        break
    except:
        break

    # ExposeEvent are received when we need to refresh the content of the
    # window, so we copy the content of the pixmap (where cairo drew) in the
    # window
    if isinstance(event, ExposeEvent):
        conn.core.CopyArea(pixmap, window, gc, 0, 0, 0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT)
    # You click, I quit.
    elif isinstance(event, ButtonPressEvent):
        break
    conn.flush()
{% endsyntax %}

Seeing the complexity it is to draw something simple with this technology, I
somehow understand why nobody bothered to release or use the code during the
last 3 years.

But hey, now that it's out, you can build the next Python based desktop
environment with bleeding edge technologies. :-)
