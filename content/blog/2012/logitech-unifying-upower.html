A few months ago, [I wrote about my reverse engineering attempt to Logitech
Unifying devices](/blog/2012/logitech-k750-linux-support). Back then, I
concluded my post with big hopes on the future after receiving a document
with some part of the specification of the HID++ 2.0 from Logitech.

A couple of weeks ago, some of my summer work has been merged to
[UPower](http://upower.freedesktop.org/), adding battery support for some
Logitech devices.

# HID++

As I discovered late in my first reverse engineering attempt, Logitech
developed a custom HID protocol named HID++. This protocol exists in two
versions, 1.0 and 2.0. Some devices talk with version 1 of the protocol
(like my M705 mouse) and some others talk with version 2 of the protocol
(like my K750 keyboard).

Recently, I've been able to be in touch with a Logitech engineer who worked
on the Linux support for the Unifying receiver, and he has been really
helpful and exposed me some details about this protocol.

Logitech made the decision to publish their HID++ specification publicly
about a year ago, but still didn't do it. The internal review needed to
publish such documents hasn't be done yet. The [only published
draft](http://6xq.net/git/lars/lshidpp.git/plain/doc/logitech_hidpp_2.0_specification_draft_2012-06-04.pdf)
is just an extract of the specification, with even some typo in it as I
discovered.

Some [other
documents](https://drive.google.com/?tab=mo&pli=1&authuser=0#folders/0BxbRzx7vEV7eWmgwazJ3NUFfQ28)
have been recently published, but I didn't have the time to review them.
They contains HID++ 1.0 specifications and some details I asked for about
the K750 keyboard.

It took me sometime to get a full understanding of the protocol, its
different version etc. After reverse engineering my K750 keyboard, I've also
reverse engineered the data stream used to get my M705 mouse battery status.
I've also received some information about the HID++ 1.0 protocol, so I've
been able to discover a bit more on what the packets mean. Most of my
discoveries are now used to do proper <code>#define</code> in
<a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/upower/tree/src/linux/up-device-lg-unifying.c"><code>up-lg-unifying.c</code></a>
so the code makes more sense.

My [first
patch](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/upower/commit/?id=2f03ad62b520fc5c02e3ff9eb5bffc4275eb88dc)
implements a new property for UPower devices, named *luminosity*, that use
with K750 keyboard to report the light level received. The [second
patch](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/upower/commit/?id=95184593504bca5240ecd296db98954decd2c5a5)
add support for Logitech Unifying devices (over USB only) and should work
with at least Logitech M705 and K750 devices. This should be available with
the next version of UPower, which should be 0.9.19.

So far, Logitech has been kind enough to help me understanding part of the
protocol and even sent me a few devices so I can play and test my work with
them. Unfortunately, this will probably requires some work and time, and so
far Logitech was not able to help with that.

There should be enough information out there to at least add support for
battery to HID++ 2.0 devices, and probably a few other things too. I hope
I'd get the time do this at some point, but feel free to beat me in this
race!
