I use [Google Calendar](http://google.com/calendar) to manage my calendars,
and I really missed something to warn me whenever I have an appointment with
an alert set.

{% endmark %}
{% endblock %}

So here is an example of a Python program to do such a thing. It is written using
the [Google Data APIs Python client library](http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/)
and pynotify.

I'll detail the code here, so you can build your own and adapt it to your needs.

First, we need to import GTK+ and pynotify, and initialize it.

{% syntax python %}
import gtk
import pynotify
pynotify.init(sys.argv[0])
{% endsyntax %}

Then, we need to import gdata Calendar API and connect to the calendar. I'll
use the simple email/password way to login, which is clearly not the best,
but it's also the simplest. Feel free to use OAuth 2.0. :-)

{% syntax python %}
calendar_service = gdata.calendar.service.CalendarService()
calendar_service.email = 'mygooglelogin'
calendar_service.password = 'mygooglepassword'
calendar_service.ProgrammaticLogin()
{% endsyntax %}

Now we're ready to request stuff and notify! First, request the events from
the default calendar.

{% syntax python %}
feed = calendar_service.GetCalendarEventFeed()
{% endsyntax %}

Now we can iterate over *feed* and do various checks.

{% syntax python %}
for event in feed.entry:
    # If the event status is not confirmed, go to the next event.
    if event.event_status.value != "CONFIRMED":
        continue
    # Now iterate over all the event dates (usually it has one)
    for when in event.when:
        # Parse start and end time
        try:
            start_time = datetime.datetime.strptime(when.start_time.split(".")[0], "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S")
            end_time = datetime.datetime.strptime(when.end_time.split(".")[0], "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S")
        except ValueError:
            # ValueError happens on parsing error. Parsing errors
            # usually happen for "all day" events since they have
            # not time, but we do not care about this events.
            continue
        now = datetime.datetime.now()
        # Check that the event hasn't already ended
        if end_time > now:
            # Check each alert
            for reminder in when.reminder:
                # We handle only reminders with method "alert"
                # and whose start time minus the reminder delay has passed
                if reminder.method == "alert" \
                        and start_time - datetime.timedelta(0, 60 * int(reminder.minutes)) < now:
                    # Build the notification
                    notification = pynotify.Notification(summary=event.title.text,
                                                         message=event.content.text)
                    # Set an icon from the GTK+ stock icons
                    notification.set_icon_from_pixbuf(gtk.Label().render_icon(gtk.STOCK_DIALOG_INFO,
                                                                              gtk.ICON_SIZE_LARGE_TOOLBAR))
                    notification.set_timeout(0)
                    # Show the notification
                    notification.show()
{% endsyntax %}

Running this program, you should see a notification if an appointment has an
alert to be raised at that time.

This should be enough to start to build something.

If you don't want to program this into Python, you might want to take a look
at [gcalcli](http://code.google.com/p/gcalcli/wiki/HowTo).
