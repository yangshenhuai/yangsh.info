I was at the [OpenStack France meetup 2](http://www.meetup.com/OpenStack-France/events/84177022/) yesterday
evening.

This has been a wonderful evening, talking about OpenStack and all with
around 30-40 people. I and [Nick Barcet](http://nicolas.barcet.com/)
presented [Ceilometer](http://launchpad.net/ceilometer) and have received
some good feedbacks about it. We should also thanks
[Nebula](http://www.nebula.com/), who sponsored the evening, and [Erwan
Gallen](http://erwan.com/) since it was nicely organized, and free beers are
always enjoyable.

For people interested, the [slides of our Ceilometer presentations are
available](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1i30roVZp00Wvo46F4k5CT98sw2uMgaf5Lh3bSfiQ-Cg/edit).
This is a lighter and fresher version of the [slides used by Nick and Doug
at the OpenStack Design
Summit](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ytYhQGR5SxoccZ-wuza2n0H2mS7HniP9HoFDUpuGDiM/edit).
