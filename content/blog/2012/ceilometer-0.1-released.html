After 6 months of development, we are proud to release the first release of
[Ceilometer](http://launchpad.net/ceilometer), the
[OpenStack](http://openstack.org) Metering project. Ceilometer. This is a
first and amazing milestone for us: we follow all other projects by
releasing a version for Folsom!

Using Ceilometer, you should now be able to meter your OpenStack cloud and
retrieve its usage to build statistics or bill your customer!

You can read [our announcement on the OpenStack mailing list](https://lists.launchpad.net/openstack/msg17410.html).

# Architecture

We spent a good amount of time defining and refining [our
architecture](http://ceilometer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/architecture.html#high-level-description).

</a>

One of its important point, is that it has been designed to work without
modifying any of the existing core components. Patching OpenStack components
in an intrusive way to meter them was not an option for now, simply because
we had no legitimacy to do so. This may change in the future, and this will
likely be discussed next week during the [OpenStack
Summit](http://www.openstack.org/summit/san-diego-2012/).

# Meters

Initially, we defined a bunch of meters we'd like to have for a first
release, and in the end, most of them are available. Some of them are still
missing, like OpenStack Object Storage (Swift) ones, mainly due to lack of
interest from the involved parties so far.

Anyhow, with this first release, you should be able to meter your instances,
their network usage, memory, CPU. Images, networks and volumes and their
CRUD operations are metered too. For more detail, you can read the [complete
list of implemented
meters](http://ceilometer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/measurements.html).

# REST API

The HTTP REST API has been partially implemented. The provided methods
should allow basic integration with a billing system.

[DreamHost](http://dreamhost.com/) is using Ceilometer in their deployment
architecture and coupling it with their billing system!

# Towards Grizzly

We don't have a clear and established road-map for Grizzly yet.

We already have a couple of patches waiting in the queue to be merged, like
the use of [Keystone to authenticate API
request](https://review.openstack.org/#/c/13989/) and the [removal of Nova
DB access](https://review.openstack.org/#/c/14185/).

On my side, these last days I've been working on a small debug user
interface for the API. Ceilometer API server will return this interface if
your do an API request from a browser (i.e. requesting
<code>text/html</code> instead of <code>application/json</code>).

I hope this will help to discover Ceilometer API more easily for new comers
and leverage it to build powerful tools!

Anyhow, we have tons of idea and work to do, and I'm sure the upcoming weeks
will be very interesting. Also, we hope to be able to become an OpenStack
incubated project soon. So stay tuned!
