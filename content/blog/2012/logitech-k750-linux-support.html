A year ago, I bought a [Logitech Wireless Solar Keyboard
K750](http://www.logitech.com/keyboards/keyboards/k750-keyboard). I'm
particularly picky on keyboards, but this one is good. It has an incredible
useful feature: while being wireless, it has no need for disposable or
rechargeable batteries, it uses solar power!

My problem is that there's obviously no way to know the battery status from
Linux, the provided application only working on Windows.

And one dark night, while fragging on QuakeLive, my keyboard stopped
working: it had no battery left. This activity being quite energy consuming,
it emptied the whole battery.

Someone should write code to get the battery status and light meter from
Linux: challenge accepted!

# How the keyboard works

<img class="pull-right illustration col-xs-3"
     alt="Logitech Unifying Receiver"
     src="/media/images/logitech-unifying.jpg">

This keyboard, like many of the new wireless devices from Logitech, uses the
*Unifying* interface. It's an USB receiver that can be attached up to 6
differents devices (mouse, keyboards…). On old Linux kernel, the *Unifying*
receiver is recognized as only one keyboard and/or one mouse device.

Recently, a driver called *hid-logitech-dj* has been added to the Linux
kernel. With this driver, each device attached to the receiver is recognized
as one different device.

# What the Logitech application does

<img class="illustration pull-left col-xs-3"
     alt="Logitech Solar App"
     src="/media/images/logitech-solar-app.png">

The Logitech application under Windows works that way: you launch it, and it
displays the battery charge level. On the keyboard, there's a special
"light" button (up right). When pressed, a LED will light up on the
keyboard: green if the keyboard is receiving enough light and is charging,
red if the keyboard does not receive enough light and is therefore
discharging. Pushing this same button while the application is running will
makes the light meter activated: the application will tell you how much
[lux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux) your keyboard is receiving.

# Let's reverse engineer this

As far as I know, there's nothing in the USB HID protocol that handles this
kind of functionality (battery status, light meter…) in a standard way. So
the first task to accomplish is, unfortunately, to reverse engineer the
program.

I discovered a bit too late that [Drew Fisher did a good presentation on USB
reverse engineering at 28c3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMf55KVDPaE).
You might want to take a look at it if you want to reverse engineer on USB.
I did not need it, but I learned a few things.

Anyway, my plan was the following: run the Logitech application inside a
virtual machine running Windows, give it direct access to the USB keyboard,
and sniff what happens on the USB wire.

To achieve that, you need a virtual machine emulator that can do USB
pass-through. Both [KVM](http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page) and
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) can do that, but VirtualBox works
much better with USB and allow hot(un)plugging of devices, so I used it.

To sniff what happens on the USB, you need to load the *usbmon* Linux kernel
module. Simply doing <code>modprobe usbmon</code> will work. You can then
use [Wireshark](http://www.wireshark.org/) which know how to use *usbmon*
devices and understand the USB protocol.

## USB stuff you need to know

You don't need to know much about USB to understand what I'll write about
below, but for the sake of comprehensibility I'll write a couple of things
here before jumping in.

To communicate with an USB device, we communicate with one of its
*endpoints*. Endpoints are regrouped into an *interface*. Interfaces are
regrouped into a *configuration*. A device might contains one or several
configurations.

There's also several types of packets in the USB wire protocol, and at least
two of them interest us there, they are:

- Interrupt packets, a packet send spontaneously;
- Controls packets, used for command and status operations.

All of this and more is well (and better) explained in the [chapter
13](http://lwn.net/images/pdf/LDD3/ch13.pdf) of [Linux Device Drivers, Third
Edition](http://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/).

## Sniffed data

Once everything was set-up, I ran my beloved Wireshark. There's a
an <abbr title="USB Request Block">URB</abbr> of type *interrupt* sent each
time you press any key with some data in it. Therefore I advise you to plug
another keyboard (or use the laptop keyboard if you're doing this on a
laptop), otherwise you'll get crazy trying to sniff the keyboard you're
typing on.

At this point, just launching the application does a bunch of USB traffic.
Pressing the "light" button on the keyboard makes even more USB packets
coming in and out. Here's the interesting packets that I noticed once I
excluded the noise:

- When pressing the "light" button, an URB of type *interrupt* is sent by the
  keyboard to the computer;
- An URB *control* packet is sent by the computer to the keyboard in
  response;
- Regularly URB *interrupt* packets are sent just after.

With all this, the next step was clear: understand the packets and reproduce
that exchange under Linux.


## What the packets mean

### The "go for the light meter" packet

The packet sent from the computer to the keyboard is the following.

<figure>
<pre>

        ReportID: 16
        ReportType: Output (2)

    wLength: 7

</pre>
</figure>

What's here interesting is the last part representing the data. *wLength*
says that the length of the data is 7 bytes, so let's take a look at those 7
bytes: <code>10 01 09 03 78 01 00</code>.

Well, actually, you can't decode them like that, unless you're a freak or a
Logitech engineer. And I have actually no idea what they mean. But sending
this to the keyboard will trigger an interesting thing: the keyboard will
start sending URB interrupt with some data without you pressing any more key.

### The "light meter and battery values" packet

This is most interesting packet. This is the one sent by the keyboard to the
host and that contains the data we want to retrieve.

0050  00 00 00 00                                       ....

</pre>
</figure>

This packets come in regularly (1 per second) on the wire for some time once
you sent the "go for the light meter" packet. At one point they are emitted
less often and do not contain the value for the light meter anymore,
suggesting that the control packet sent earlier triggers the activation of
the light meter for a defined period.

Now you probably wonder where the data are in this. They're in the 20 bytes
leftover in the capture data part, indicated by Wireshark, at the end of the
packet: <code>11 02 09 10 39 00 0c 06 1d 47 4f 4f 44 00 00 00 00 00 00 00</code>.

Fortunately, it was easy to decode. Knowing we're looking for 2 values
(battery charge and light meter), we just need to observe and compare the
packet emitted on the wire with the values displayed by the Logitech Solar
App.

To achieve this, I looked both at the *Logitech Solar App* and *Wireshark*
while bringing more and more light near the keyboard, increasing the lux
value received by the meter on the Solar App, and saw that the fields
represented in blue (see below) where changing in Wireshark. Since 2 bytes
were changing, I guessed that it was coded on 16 bits, and therefore it was
easy to correlate the value with the Solar App.

<figure>
<pre>
[ ....<span style="color:red;">9</span><span style="color: blue;">..</span>..<span style="color: green;">GOOD</span>....... ]
11 02 09 10 <span style="color: red;">39</span> <span style="color: blue;">00 0c</span> 06 1d <span style="color: green;">47 4f 4f 44</span> 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
4 bytes - <span style="color: red">1 byte for battery charge</span> - <span style="color: blue;">2 bytes for light meter</span> - 2 bytes - <span style="color: green">4 bytes for GOOD</span> - 7 bytes
</pre>
</figure>

In this example, the battery has a charge of <code>0x39 = 57 %</code> and
the light meter receives <code>0x0c = 12 lux</code> of light. It's basically
dark, and that makes sense: it was night and the light was off in my office,
the only light being the one coming from my screen.

I've no idea what the <code>GOOD</code> part of the packet is about, but
it's present in every packet and it's actually very handy to recognize such
a packet. Therefore I'm considering this as some sort of useful mark for
now.

For the other bytes, they were always the same (<code>0x11 0x2 0x9
0x10</code> at the beginning, 7 times <code>0x00</code> at the end). The 2
bytes between the light meter and GOOD probably mean something, but I've no
idea what for now.

# Building our solar app

Now we've enough information to build our own very basic solar application.
We know how to triggers the light meter, and we know how to decode the
packets.

We're going to write a small application using
[libusb](http://www.libusb.org/). Here's a quick example. It's not perfect
and does not check for error codes, be careful.

What the program is doing is the following:

- Request for the Unifying Receiver device based on vendor and product ID
- Get the HID interface
- Detach the HID interface from the kernel driver
- Claim the interface
- Send a control packets, were parameters are defined using the same data we captured earlier
- Read interrupt packets coming in until we receive one we recognize (length
  20 containing the "GOOD" string)
- Decode the content (battery charge & light meter)
- Release the interface
- Reattach the kernel driver to the interface

This gives the following:

<pre>
Found keyboard 0x0x24ec8e0
Charge: 64 %
Light: 21 lux
</pre>

Challenge accomplished!

# To be continued

Unfortunately, this approach has at least one major drawback. We have to
disconnect the *Logitech Unifying Receiver* from the kernel. That means that
while we're waiting for the packet, we're dropping packets corresponding to
other events from every connected device (key presses, pointer motions…).

In order to solve that, I sent a request for help on the
[linux-input](http://vger.kernel.org/vger-lists.html#linux-input) mailing
list. That way, I learned that Logitech is actually using the HID++ protocol
to communicate with the devices using the Unifying Receiver. [Lars-Dominik
Braun](http://6xq.net) managed to get the HID++ specifications from Logitech
and [published
them](http://6xq.net/git/lars/lshidpp.git/plain/doc/logitech_hidpp_2.0_specification_draft_2012-06-04.pdf)
with their authorization.

This opens a whole new world. With that document, I may be able to
understand the part I reverse engineered and convert this to a more useful
and generic library using the hidraw interface (so we don't have to
disconnect the devices from the kernel driver).
