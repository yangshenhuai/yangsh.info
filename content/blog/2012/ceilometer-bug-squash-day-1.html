In order to start the year in a good mood, what's the best than squashing
some bugs on OpenStack?

Therefore, the Ceilometer team is pleased [to
announce](http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2012-December/004161.html)
that it organizes a [bug squashing day on the Friday 4th January
2013](http://wiki.openstack.org/Ceilometer/BugSquashingDay/20130104).

We wrote an extensive page about [how you can contribute to
Ceilometer](http://wiki.openstack.org/Ceilometer/Contributing), from
updating the documentation, to fixing bugs. There's a lot you can do. We've
good support for Ceilometer built into [Devstack](http://devstack.org), so
installing a development platform is really easy.

The main goal on this bug day will be put Ceilometer in the best possible
shape before the *grizzly-2* milestone arrives (10th January 2013). This
version of Ceilometer will aim to keep compatibility with *Folsom*, so early
deployers can enjoy some of our new features before upgrading to *Grizzly*.
After that date, we'll start merging more extensive changes.

We'll be hanging out on the *#openstack-metering* IRC channel on
[Freenode](http://freenode.net), as usual, so feel free to come by and join
us!
