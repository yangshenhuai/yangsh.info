I've finally published my Emacs configuration.

{% endmark %}
{% endblock %}

This took me a while, since I had personal information inside (like
passwords). Recently, I've been able to move them away and can now publish
everything in my [Git
repository](https://github.com/jd/emacs.d.git).

It's probably not yet usable from scratch, since I didn't include the
bootstrap code for [el-get](http://github.com/dimitri/el-get). But you can
at least lurk and grab some ideas or lines of code. And do not hesitate to
ask me anything about it!

Note that I'm using Emacs development version (trunk), so it's possible that
some things do not work with (old) released Emacs versions.
