[hyde](http://hyde.github.io/) is a static Website generator which is written in
[Python](https://www.python.org/).and as a fan of Python ,I choose hyde to generate my blog
{% endmark %}
{% endblock %}

## But it seems a big mistake from begining.

I admit hyde is very cool and powerful tool. but the most frustrating part is
that there's not much documents and examples for beginners,
you need to explore it yourself and even read the source code of hyde.
here's how I finally make it basiclly work .

## Installing

<div class="illustration pull-right icon">
  <img src="/media/images/python.png">
</div>
hyde need Python2.7 or above to work, but not support Python3 yet.
But my server is running a centos-6 which requires a Python2.6,
If you want directly install Python2.7,
you need to follow a [sequence of operation](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-2/wiki/Installing-python-2.7-on-centos-6.3.-Follow-this-sequence-exactly-for-centos-machine-only)
, otherwise it will destroy your system.
so I choose another easy way to prepare the environment , use [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html)
it have very clear document, you can follow the guide to create a seperate Python enviroment for hyde.
After setup Python2.7 env, you can install the [dependency of the hyde](http://hyde.github.io/install.html).
after dependency installed, you can finally install hyde.
{% syntax shell %}
pip install hyde
{% endsyntax %}


##Creating Basic Template
to create a site ,simply use
{% syntax shell %}
hyde -s ~/blog -v create -l basic
{% endsyntax %}
-s means where the site should be created ,-v means should log detailed message to console ,
-l means which template you want to use , currently hyde only have 3 layouts to choose , <b>basic</b> ,<b>test</b> and <b>doc</b>
after this command finish , a folder named <em>blog</em> should be created under you directory
and under that folder ,there will be another tow folders ,<b>layout</b> have all your template,<b>content</b> have all your contents.
in in folder content, there's a folder named <b>media</b> stores all the images,css,js etc.

##Generating Website
if you create the template successfuly, next step would be generate,
so you can have a package to deploy to [apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) or
[nginx](http://nginx.org/en/)
{% syntax shell %}
hyde -s ~/blog -v gen -d ~/deploy -c site.yaml
{% endsyntax %}
 if you're lucky, you can have u own site now!
 but i am the unluck guy, when I run <b>gen</b> command, it always fail and throw
this error TemplateAssertionError("no filter named 'typogrify'") , and since typogrify is a enhancement tool ,so I just delete typogrify from template <b>base.j2</b>
   and then it can work

##Finally,Run it
 now you can copy the deploy folder to apache or any other folder, but for test ,
 hyde also have a build-in web server

{% syntax shell %}
hyde -s ~/blog -v serve -d ~/deploy -c site.yaml -a localhost -p 8080
{% endsyntax %}
  now visit localhost:8080 , you will see what you get!


##Write your own template
  its nice to have this working website , but I had to say the basic template of hyde is not good-looking,
  But there're a lot of nice-looking website template you can download from internet such as
 [freehtml5templates] (http://www.freehtml5templates.com/).
 after you download a template and unzipped it,usually it contains a ***index.html***
 there's a file with a same name in your content folder,but that is actually a
[Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/) template , so you can copy the html as ***.j2*** to the ***layout*** folder
        at same time , you also need to download css ,images and js files to ***media*** folder
{% syntax shell %}
        cp $HTML_TEMP/index.html $HYDE/layout/my_index.j2
        cp -r $HTML_TEMP/css/* $HYDE/media/css
        cp -r $HTML_TEMP/images/* $HYDE/media/images
{% endsyntax %}
now , you need to turn the designed template to Jinja2 template, in order to do that , you need to figure out
 what is general to all pages and what is specific to each one
take a below html head as a example
 {% syntax html %}
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Minimalism - Home</title>
    <link rel="icon" href="images/favicon.gif" type="image/x-icon"/>
    <!--[if lt IE 9]>
    <script src="http://html5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js">
    </script>
    <![endif]-->
    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="images/favicon.gif" type="image/x-icon"/>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/styles.css"/>
</head>
{% endsyntax %}
in this case pretty much every thing but the title is shared ,so we will just title content into
a template field from metadata
{% syntax html %}
<title>{{ resource.meta.title }}</title>
{% endsyntax %}
The head element also links to icons ,styles and other resources.Hyde manages the correspondence between the folders
 for such resources and their URLS in result pages so you have to update these links to use a special Hyde function
  {% syntax html %}
    <link rel="icon" href="{{ media_url('images/favicon.gif') }}" type="image/x-icon"/>
    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="{{ media_url('images/favicon.gif') }}"
          type="image/x-icon"/> <link rel="stylesheet"
                                      href="{{ media_url('css/styles.css') }}" type="text/css"/>
 {% endsyntax %}
now let's fill the content , you can easily to mark place in the template where you
want to fill in page-specific markup ,Just add Jinja block markers
