Recently I have used the tomcat for the project (last time I used it was like five years ago...) , and I find some little tips very useful , also its may be very basic usage of tomcat to you.
{% endmark %}

#set some env variable specific for tomcat

just create a new file `setenv.sh`(`setenv.bat` in windows), and declare env variable in that file
{% syntax shell %}
spring.active.profiles=PROD
{% endsyntax %}
in this way , you can config variables just for tomcat , and it wouldn't mess up with your system-range variables

#set up your application as the default app

suppose your have a web app(war package or just a web content folder) named A(A.war or just a folder name A)
your have to access your app by request http://host:port/A/ . 

now your want to access your app by request http://host:port/ ( A as the default application ).

there're several ways to achieve this [tomcat how-to](https://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/HowTo#How_do_I_make_my_web_application_be_the_Tomcat_default_application.3F)

one of the best way I think is this
- Place your war file outside of CATALINA_BASE/webapps (it must be outside to prevent double deployment).
- Place a context file named ROOT.xml in CATALINA_BASE/conf/<engine name>/<host name> (normally  CATALINA_BASE/conf/Catalina/localhost).
{% syntax shell %}
<Context docBase="{path_to_your_soft_link_file}" allowLinking="true" reloadable="true"/>
{% endsyntax %}

The best way is to create a softlink somewhere(need allowLinking="true") so when deploy a new package  don't need  to change this ROOT.xml any more , just make the softlink point to new file and tomcat will auto reload the application (reloadable = true )

#start tomcat when system start up

can configure tomcat auto start up when system start up . in centos just edit `/etc/rc.d/rc.local` and add one more line in rc.local
{% syntax shell %}
CATALINA_BASE/bin/startup.sh
{% endsyntax %}

but if just this , you will find out the tomcat start using root account

if you just want specific user to start up tomcat please change the line as below
{% syntax shell %}
#use tomcat user to start tomcat
su tomcat CATALINA_BASE/bin/startup.sh
{% endsyntax %}



#JMX monitoring

suppose your have a working tomcat running in your test server, you may want to do some performance test and monitor the heap memory usage at the same time.
To add JMX monitoring just add below configuration to your `setenv.sh`
{% syntax shell %}
export CATALINA_OPTS=" $CATALINA_OPTS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote"
export CATALINA_OPTS=" $CATALINA_OPTS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=%my.jmx.port%"
export CATALINA_OPTS=" $CATALINA_OPTS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false"
export CATALINA_OPTS=" $CATALINA_OPTS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=true"
export CATALINA_OPTS=" $CATALINA_OPTS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.password.file=../conf/jmxremote.password"
export CATALINA_OPTS=" -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.access.file=../conf/jmxremote.access"
{% endsyntax %}

and edit `jmxremote.access`
{% syntax shell %}
monitorRole readonly
controlRole readwrite
{% endsyntax %}
finally edit $CATALINA_BASE/conf/jmxremote.password (this file must be readonly for user which run tomcat , if its the same user which create this file , you can run chmod 600 jmxremote.password )
{% syntax shell %}
monitorRole password
controlRole password
{% endsyntax %}
after restart tomcat , you can connect tomcat with jconsole.
