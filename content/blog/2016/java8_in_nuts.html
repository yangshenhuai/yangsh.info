{% block excerpt %}
{% mark excerpt %}

[Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/index.html) is a old Object-oritented programming language.
But recently,functional programming languages has risen in importance,
because its very suitable for cocurrent and reactive programming ,
so java8 has add functional programing to makes it mordern java

# Lambdas

Lambda is a block of code that you can pass around so it can be executed later.

{% syntax Java %}
Comparator  comparator = (String s1, String s2) -> compare(s1.length(), s2.length()); //basic syntax (param) -> an expression
Comparator<String> comparator = (s1,s2) -> compare(s1.length(),s2.length()); // if param type can be inferred ,you can omit the type.
EventHandler<ActionEvent> listener = event -> System.out.println("Thanks for clicking!"); // if single parameter,you can omit the ()
{% endsyntax %}
you not need to specify the result type of lambda expression, it always inferred from the context
{% syntax Java %}
(String first, String second) -> Integer.compare(first.length(), second.length()) // can be used in a context where a int is expected
{% endsyntax %}
If you want to return in values in lambda expression, make sure there's a value return in all branches
{% syntax Java %}
        (int x) -> { if (x >= 0) return 1; } //Invalid
{% endsyntax %}

## functional interface
a interface with a single abstract method is called functional interface
you can use lambda expression whenever a object of functional interface expected
{% syntax Java %}
        Arrays.sort(words,
        (first, second) -> Integer.compare(first.length(), second.length()));
{% endsyntax %}
The Arrays.sort receive an object of Comparator (functional interface),
when invoke <em>compare</em> method (the abstract method),the lambda expression executed

##Method Reference
Sometimes there's already a method that carries out the action you'd like to pass on to
some other code.
{% syntax Java %}
button.setOnAction(event -> System.out.println(event)); // is same as below
button.setOnAction(System.out::println); // is same as above
{% endsyntax %}

three types of method reference
- object::instanceMethod
- Class::staticMethod
- Class::instanceMethd
