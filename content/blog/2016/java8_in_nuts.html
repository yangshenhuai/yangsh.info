# Lambdas

Lambda is a block of code that you can pass around so it can be executed later.

{% syntax Java %}
Comparator  comparator = (String s1, String s2) -> compare(s1.length(), s2.length()); //basic syntax (param) -> an expression
Comparator<String> comparator = (s1,s2) -> compare(s1.length(),s2.length()); // if param type can be inferred ,you can omit the type.
EventHandler<ActionEvent> listener = event -> System.out.println("Thanks for clicking!"); // if single parameter,you can omit the ()
{% endsyntax %}
you never need to specify the result type of lambda expression, it always inferred from the context
{% syntax Java %}
(String first, String second) -> Integer.compare(first.length(), second.length()) // can be used in a context where a int is expected
{% endsyntax %}
