Last night I had a interview, and I realized that my ability to coding and some basic knowleges is a little worse than I used to be , 
so I will record all the interview(interesting) questions I have meet.

#Q1 - the sequence to init the object in java
this is very basic knowledage in java,and I think I am right when I do it in interview ,but I was not very sure about the result
the question almost like this , and it ask you what's the output when you run the test.
{% syntax java %}
class Parent {
        protected String name;
        Parent(){
            System.out.println(1);
        }
        Parent(String name) {
            System.out.println(2);
            this.name = name;
        }

    }
    class Child extends  Parent{

        Child() {
            System.out.println(3);
        }

        Child(String name) {
            System.out.println(4);
            Parent p = new Parent("F:" + name);
            this.name = name;
        }

    }
    @Test
    public void testSequenceWhenConstructChildWithParameter(){
        Parent parent = new Child("Test");
    }
{% endsyntax %}
acctually , lets look the Child.class  the java compiled .
{% syntax java %}
Child(SequenceOfConstructorTest this$0)
  {
    super();
    System.out.println(3);
  }
  
  Child(SequenceOfConstructorTest, String name)
  {
    super();
    System.out.println(4);
    SequenceOfConstructorTest.Parent p = new SequenceOfConstructorTest.Parent( "F:" + name);
    this.name = name;
  }
{% endsyntax %}

yeah, the first statement in a constructor is the chaining of super class constructor.In fact, the first statement in any constructor chains to the super class constructor , so the result ould be 1 4 2
