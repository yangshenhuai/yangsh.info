When I started to use Emacs, I got hooked by many stuff like [Gnus](http://gnus.org) and
[Org-mode](http://orgmode.org). One thing I quickly started to hate is how the Lisp code can be
old and unmaintained. That especially applies to [BBDB](http://bbdb.sourceforge.net), which has been
unmaintained for years, and has very very very old and obsolete code.

Therefore I've decided to develop my own BBDB replacement based on my lovely
Org-mode. It's called [org-contacts](http://julien.danjou.info/org-contacts.html), and it allows you to handle your contact
like anything you would handle in Org. This way you can manage them the way
you want, without any preset fields or any assumptions like BBDB has.

I had the chance to present it at the Paris OrgCamp a couple of weeks ago,
and due to the enthusiastic audience I had, I'm now releasing it to the wide
Internet.
