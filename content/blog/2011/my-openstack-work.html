Like I already wrote here last week, I've been heavily working on
[OpenStack](http://openstack.org) for the last weeks.

My first assignment was to package OpenStack for Debian. The packages
already present in unstable were mainly done by [Thomas
Goirand](http://thomas.goirand.fr/), who based its work on the one done in
[Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com). Therefore, the packages where not in a very
good shape for Debian.

Today Ghe Rivero and I (members of the [OpenStack Debian packaging
team](https://alioth.debian.org/projects/openstack)) managed to push the
[OpenStack Essex 2
milestone](https://launchpad.net/openstack/+milestone/essex-2) into unstable
with great success. You can now test and deploy OpenStack Essex 2 very easily!

Packaging OpenStack [made me write several
patches](https://review.openstack.org/#dashboard,1669), mainly related to
packaging, patches which were all accepted and merged by upstream. This is
nice because most of the OpenStack Debian packages lost their
*debian/patches* directories now!

Finally, I've finished to implement one blueprint I really missed: the
[ability to boot from an ISO
image](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/support-kvm-boot-from-iso)
using [libvirt](http://libvirt.org). The code still needs a review, but it
should be included in the Essex 3 milestone if everything's right.
