Yesterday afternoon, I was at the first [OrgCamp in Paris](http://www.lifehacking.fr/mediawiki/index.php/OrgModeCampJanvier2011).

It was my first attendance to a
[BarCamp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp), and I really liked it. It's
basically the first geek event I do not find boring nor useless.

There was about 18-20 persons participating, which was quite high, since we
all initially though we would have been only 5.

We had several presentations of various features and personal usages of
[BBDB](http://www.orgmode.org][Org-mode]]. For my part, I've quickly presented the agenda, and my [[http://bbdb.sourceforge.net/)
replacement named **org-contacts** (I'll probably talk about it on this blog in
another post later).

The only downside was that Bastien (the new Org-mode maintainer) was not
able to come and join us. On the other side, there were so much to tell for
a first time, I did not have so much time to code. I only have been able to
[fix one bug](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2011-01/msg01002.html) reported during my agenda presentation.

In the end, the overall atmosphere was very enthusiastic and friendly, which
was extremely pleasant. The #org-mode-fr IRC channel has been created on
[Freenode](http://freenode.net), following this event. Feel free to join us.

Since people liked it so badly, it seems there should be another barcamp in
the next months. Stay tuned.
