It took me a while to find this, so I'm just blogging it so other people
will be able to find it.

I wanted to send a [desktop
notification](http://www.galago-project.org/specs/notification/) using
pynotify, but using a [GTK+ stock
icons](http://developer.gnome.org/gtk/2.24/gtk-Stock-Items.html).

With the following snippet, I managed to do it.

{% syntax python %}
import pynotify
pynotify.init("myapp")
import gtk
n = pynotify.Notification(summary="Summary", message="Message!")
n.set_icon_from_pixbuf(gtk.Label().render_icon(gtk.STOCK_HARDDISK, gtk.ICON_SIZE_LARGE_TOOLBAR))
n.show()
{% endsyntax %}

Note that the use of a *Label* is just to have a widget instanciated to use
the *render_icon()* method. It could be any widget type as far as I
understand.
