[git-annex](http://git-annex.branchable.com/) is a recent tool allowing to manage files with git without having
theirs contents checked into git.

I've been looking at it with some interest in
the past few weeks in order to use it to handle my music collection on the
various computers I use.

My laptop just got a new SSD drive which is quite small and cannot handle
the whole collection. By using git-annex, I'm now able to only check out
part of my music collection and keeping it synchronized with all my others
computers.

Using *git-annex* is pretty trivial once you understand the concepts.

I've set up a a git repository in my *Music* directory, like that:

<pre>
% git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/jd/Music
</pre>

Then I initialized git annex:

<pre>
% git annex init "Music on keller"
</pre>

So now I'm able to import all my data into git annex. *git-annex* offers
several backends to store data. WORM is the default, but is not a good
choice for file that could be modified, and music files can be, at least
when editing the metadata. Therefore, I chose the slow but more reliable
SHA1 backend.

<pre>
% git annex add --backend=SHA1 .
</pre>

That can be long, so you should be patient. Then you should commit the fact
you annexed files:

<pre>
% git commit -a -m "Imported my music collection"
[master 82d060f] Imported my music collection
</pre>

Now, it's done. You can go on another computer and clone the repo:

<pre>
% git clone ssh://keller/~/Music
% cd Music
% git annex get "Incubus - Light Grenades"
</pre>

And then let the magic happens. It will retrieve the whole directory for
you. Do not forgot to commit the fact that you got those album on that
machine!

The concept used by git-annex is quite simple. All files are replaced by
symlinks pointing to *.git-annex/SHA1:filechecksum.log*. This file contains
lines, whose format is:

<pre>
retrieval-timestamp is-file-present uuid-of-the-repository
</pre>

Indicating if the file is present in a repository. This logs file are
commited into the repository, whereas the real content is stored in the
*.git/annex* directory and therefore not commited.

I recommend to take a look to the [walkthrough](http://git-annex.branchable.com/walkthrough/) page to get more idea and what
you can and [cannot](http://git-annex.branchable.com/not/) do with git-annex.
