After more than 5 years at [Easter-eggs](http://www.easter-eggs.com) as a
system engineer, I'll be leaving my job soon.

It has been a fabulous adventure, also due to the "cooperative" nature of
the company. I've enjoyed worked here, with great people. I do wish them
luck for the future. Looking at the numerous things I did for the past
years, it has been quite productive!

Therefore, I'll be looking for a new job in the next weeks, which will
probably keep me busy a bit. :-)
