It has been a while since I blogged but I've been very busy, with my new job and this new blog!

# New job!

I quitted my job last September, and found another one that I started in
October. I'm now the lead developer of [eNovance
Labs](http://www.enovance.com/fr/produits-solutions/opencloud-opensource/enovance-labs),
where I work on the [OpenStack](http://openstack.org/) project. So far, this allowed me to contribute heavily to the [Debian packaging of OpenStack](https://alioth.debian.org/projects/openstack).

# New blog!

In the meantime, I took some time to redesign my personal homepage and this
blog, which is now using [Hyde](https://github.com/hyde/hyde), the
[Python](http://python.org) equivalent of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/),
which is in [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/). Since I dislike Ruby
(sorry), I preferred to use a Python based generator, and I admit Hyde is really
cool.
Since I really suck at Web design, this one is obviously based on [Twitter's bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
