I finally finished a thing I was really missing: accessing my Google
Contacts from Emacs.

That's now possible, thanks to my new
[google-contacts.el](/software/google-contacts.el)
package.

It includes searching for any contact and displaying the result in a window.
You can also jump to a contact from [Gnus](http://gnus.org) by pressing a
key, and complete e-mail addresses while composing a mail.
