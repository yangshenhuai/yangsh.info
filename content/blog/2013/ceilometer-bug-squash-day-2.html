The Ceilometer team is pleased [to
announce](http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2013-March/006188.html)
that tomorrow [Tuesday 5th March 2013 will be the second bug squash day for
Ceilometer](http://wiki.openstack.org/Ceilometer/BugSquashingDay/20130304).

We wrote an extensive page about [how you can contribute to
Ceilometer](http://wiki.openstack.org/Ceilometer/Contributing), from
updating the documentation, to fixing bugs. There's a lot you can do. We've
good support for Ceilometer built into [Devstack](http://devstack.org), so
installing a development platform is really easy.

The main goal for this bug day will be to put Ceilometer in the best
possible shape before the *grizzly-rc1* release arrives (14th March 2013).
This version of Ceilometer *should* be the last one before the final Grizzly
release, so it's a pretty important one.

We'll be hanging out on the *#openstack-metering* IRC channel on
[Freenode](http://freenode.net), as usual, so feel free to come by and join
us!
