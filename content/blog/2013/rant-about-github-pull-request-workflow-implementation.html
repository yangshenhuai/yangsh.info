One of my recent innocent tweet about *Gerrit vs Github* triggered much more
reponses and debate that I expected it to. I realize that it might be worth
explaining a bit what I meant, in a text longer than 140 characters.

# The problems with Github pull-requests

<img class="illustration pull-right col-xs-2" src="/media/images/github.svg">

I always looked at Github from a distant eye, mainly because I always
disliked their pull-request handling, and saw no value in the social hype it
brings. Why?

## One click away isn't one click effort

The pull-request system looks like an incredible easy way to contribute to
any project hosted on Github. You're a click away to send your contribution
to any software. But the problem is that any worthy contribution isn't an
effort of a single click.

Doing any proper and useful contribution to a software is never done right
the first time. There's a dance you will have to play. A slowly rhythmed
back and forth between you and the software maintainer or team. You'll have
to dance it until your contribution is correct and can be merged.

But as a software maintainer, not everybody is going to follow you on this
choregraphy, and you'll end up with pull-request you'll never get finished
unless you wrap things up yourself. So the gain in pull-requests here, isn't
really bigger than a good bug report in most cases.

This is where the social argument of Github isn't anymore. As soon as you're
talking about projects bigger than a color theme for your favorite text
editor, this feature is overrated.

## Contribution rework

If you're lucky enough, your contributor will play along and follow you on
this pull-request review process. You'll make suggestions, he will listen
and will modify his pull-request to follow your advice.

At this point, there's two technics he can use to please you.

### Technic #1: the Topping

Github's pull-requests invite you to send an entire branch, eclipsing the
fact that it is composed of several commits. The problem is that a lot of
one-click-away contributors do not masterize Git and/or do not make efforts
to build a logical patchset, and nothing warns them that their branch
history is wrong. So they tend to change stuff around, commit, make a
mistake, commit, fix this mistake, commit, etc. This kind of branch is
composed of the whole brain's construction process of your contributor, and
is a real pain to review. To the point I quite often give up.

</figure>

Without Github, the old method that all software used, and that many
software still use (e.g. Linux), is to send a patch set over e-mail (or any
other medium like Gerrit). This method has one positive effect, that it
forces the contributor to acknowledge the list of commits he is going to
publish. So, if the contributor he has fixup commits in his history, they
are going to be seen as first class citizen. And nobody is going to want to
see that, neither your contributor, nor the software maintainers. Therefore,
such a system tend to push contributors to write atomic, logical and
self-contained patchset that can be more easily reviewed.

### Technic #2: the History Rewriter

This is actually the good way to build a working and logical patchset using
Git. Rewriting history and amending problematic patches using the famous
*git rebase --interactive* trick.

The problem is that if your contributor does this and then repush the branch
composing your pull-request to Github, you will both lose the previous
review done, each time. There's no history on the different versions of the
branch that has been pushed.

In the old alternative system like e-mail, no information is lost when
reworked patches are resent, obviously. This is far better because it eases
the following of the iterative discussions that the patch triggered.

Of course, it would be possible for Github to enhance this and fix it, but
currently it doesn't handle this use case correctly..

# A quick look at OpenStack workflow

<img class="illustration pull-right col-xs-2" src="/media/images/projects/openstack.png">

It's not a secret for anyone that I've been contributing to OpenStack as a
daily routine for the last 18 months. The more I contribute, the more I like
the contribution workflow and process. It's already
[well and longly described on the wiki](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Gerrit_Workflow),
so I'll summarize here my view and what I like about it.

## Gerrit

To send a contribution to any OpenStack project, you need to pass via
Gerrit. This is way simpler than doing a pull-request on Github actually,
all you have to do is do your commit(s), and type
[*git review*](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/git-review). That's it. Your
patch will be pushed to Gerrit and available for review.

Gerrit allows other developers to review your patch, add comments anywhere
on it, and score your patch up or down. You can build any rule you want for
the score needed for a patch to be merged; OpenStack requires one positive
scoring from two core developers before the patch is merged.

Until a patch is validated, it can be reworked and amended locally using
Git, and then resent using
*git review* again. That simple.
The historic and the different version of the patches are available, with
the whole comments. Gerrit doesn't lose any historic information on your
workflow.

Finally, you'll notice that this is actually the same kind of workflow
projects use when they work by patch sent over e-mail. Gerrit just build a
single place to regroup and keep track of patchsets, which is really handy.
It's also much easier for people to actually send patch using a command line
tool than their MUA or *git send-email*.

## Gate testing

Testing is mandatory for any patch sent to OpenStack. Unit tests and
functionnals test are run for *each version of each patch of the patchset*
sent. And until your patch passes all tests, it will be *impossible* to
merge it.
Yes, this implies that all patches in a patchset must be working commits and
can be merged on their own, without the entire patchset going in! With such
a restricution, it's impossible to have "fixup commits" merged in your
project and pollute the history and the testability of the project.

Once your patch is validated by core developers, the system checks that
there is not any merge conflicts. If there's not, tests are re-run, since
the branch you are pushing to might have changed, and if everything's fine,
the patch is merged.

This is an uncredible force for the quality of the project. This implies
that no broken patchset can ever sneak in, and that the project pass always
all tests.

# Conclusion: accessibility vs code review

In the end, I think that one of the key of any development process, which is
code review, is not well covered by Github pull-request system. It is, along
with history integrity, damaged by the goal of making contributions easier.

Choosing between these features is probably a trade-off that each project
should do carefully, considering what are its core goals and the quality of
code it want to reach.

I tend to find that OpenStack found one of the best trade-off available
using Gerrit and plugging testing automation via Jenkins on it, and I would
probably recommend it for any project taking seriously code reviews and
testing.
