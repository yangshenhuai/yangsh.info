Recently, I've worked on the cloud utilities that are provided as standard
in Ubuntu, and I ported them to Debian. Let's see how that brings Debian to
the cloud!

# Basics of a cloud image

When starting an instance on a IaaS platform, your instance image is raw,
un-configured. Therefore, you need to have a way to configure it
automagically at boot time, based on what you want to do with it. Usually,
IaaS platforms provides for this a metadata server, like
[Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2) does. It's a special HTTP server
listening on a special and hard-coded IP address that your instance can
request to know basic information about itself, like its hostname, and
retrieve basic user metadata to auto-configure itself. You can check the
[documentation about the OpenStack metadata service](http://docs.openstack.org/trunk/openstack-compute/admin/content/metadata-service.html)
for more information.

Also, image have a predefined size at upload time. So when you run it on a
platform, the disk size you request is usually bigger than the size of your
image disk: you mayneed to resize and grow your image to use the full disk
space that is allocated to your instance.

To run a cloud platform, and especially
[Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2) or
[OpenStack](http://openstack.org), you need to configure and update your
image based on the context you're started in. This also includes extending
your template image disk to use the full available disk size provided to the
running instance.

Ubuntu provides a set of cloud utils, which is actually composed of
different source packages (*cloud-init*, *cloud-utils* and
*clout-initiramfs-tools*).

Combined, these 3 packages will allow you to run a number of step, from disk
resize at boot time to Puppet configuration handling.

So *Ubuntu* got this working right a long time ago, but unfortunately,
Debian was really late on that.

Until now.

I've worked on getting these into Debian, and you can now find these 3
packages adapted and uploaded to Debian sid.

All you need to do, is to build a Debian image and then run:

{% syntax sh %}
apt-get install cloud-init cloud-tools cloud-initiramfs-growroot
{% endsyntax %}

And voil√†: at the next reboot, your instance will extend its root partition
size to the full available disk size, and ask the metadata server to
configure things like its hostname.

The packages sources are available on Debian's git server for
[cloud-utils](http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=collab-maint/cloud-utils.git;a=summary)
and
[cloud-initramfs-tools](http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=collab-maint/cloud-initramfs-tools.git;a=summary)
and you can build them yourself until the packages are processed by
ftp-master and get out of the
[NEW queue](http://ftp-master.debian.org/new.html). cloud-init on the other
hand is directly
[available in sid](http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=cloud-init).

One of next steps would probably be to build or enhance a tool like
[vmbuilder](https://launchpad.net/vmbuilder) to be able to build
cloud-compatible Debian images with a simple command line.
