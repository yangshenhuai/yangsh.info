Last week, the third and last milestone of the Havana development branch of
Ceilometer has been released and is now available for testing and download.
This means the end of the OpenStack *Havana* development time is coming, and
that the features are now frozen.

# New features

Eleven blueprints have been implemented as you can see on the
[release page](https://launchpad.net/ceilometer/+milestone/havana-3). That's
one more than during Havana-2, but it's less than was planned initially,
though we had a pretty high score considering the size of our contributors
team. I'm going to talk through some of them here, that are the most
interesting for users.

* Our favorite
[OPW](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OutreachProgramForWomen) intern Terri
Yu implemented the long awaited
[GROUP BY API feature](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ceilometer/+spec/api-group-by),
that allows to group samples by fields before returning statistics.

* Eoghan Glynn (RedHat) continued his implementation of alarming features,
and the
[audit API](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ceilometer/+spec/alarm-audit-api)
has been merged. A few blueprints related to alarming slipped and will be
delayed for RC1, as they have been granted feature freeze exceptions:
[logical combinations of alarms](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ceilometer/+spec/alarming-logical-combination)
and
[alarm service partitioner](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ceilometer/+spec/alarm-service-partitioner).

* With the help of Gordon Chung (IBM), I've worked on creating a
[middleware to meter API requests](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ceilometer/+spec/count-api-requests).
This has been merged into Oslo and is handled by Ceilometer. Gordon added
another middleware on top of it to add CADF support for audit.

* Ceilometer agent compute gained his second inspector to poll for virtual
machine, thanks to Alessandro Pilotti (Cloudbase) who implemented
[the Hyper-V inspector](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ceilometer/+spec/hyper-v-agent).

* Ceilometer will be able to meter Neutron bandwidth thanks to eNovance
folks that worked on
[bandwidth metering blueprint](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ceilometer/+spec/ceilometer-quantum-bw-metering),
both on Ceilometer and Neutron parts. This is also a long awaited feature.

* Finally, Ceilometer will be shipped with yet another storage back-end, as
Tong Li (IBM) implemented a
[DB2 driver](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ceilometer/+spec/ibm-db2-support).

# Bug fixes

Fifty-six bugs were fixed, though most of them might not interest you so I
won't elaborate too much on that. Go read
[the list](https://launchpad.net/ceilometer/+milestone/havana-3) if you are
curious.

# Toward our final Havana release

With the feature freeze in place, we're now focusing on fixing bugs and
improving documentation. I'll try to make sure we'll get there without too
much trouble for the 17th October 2013. Stay tuned!
