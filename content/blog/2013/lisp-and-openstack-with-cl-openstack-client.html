A month ago, a mail hit the [OpenStack](http://openstack.org) mailing list
entitled "[The OpenStack Community Welcomes Developers in All Programming
Languages](https://lists.launchpad.net/openstack/msg24349.html)".
You may know that OpenStack is essentially built using Python, and therefore
it is the reference language for the client libraries implementations.
As a Lisp and OpenStack practitioner, I used this excuse to build a
challenge for myself: let's prove this point by bringing Lisp into
OpenStack!

Welcome
[cl-openstack-client](https://github.com/stackforge/cl-openstack-client),
the OpenStack client library for [Common Lisp](http://common-lisp.net/)!

The project is hosted on the classic OpenStack infrastructure for third
party project, [StackForge](http://ci.openstack.org/stackforge.html). It
provides the [continuous integration system based on
Jenkins](https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-cl-openstack-client-run-tests/)
and the Gerrit infrastructure used to review contributions.

# How the tests works

OpenStack projects ran a fabulous contribution workflow, [which I already
talked
about](http://julien.danjou.info/blog/2013/rant-about-github-pull-request-workflow-implementation),
based on tools like [Gerrit](http://gerrit.googlecode.com/) and
[Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/).

OpenStack Python projects are used to run
[tox](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox), to build a virtual environment and
run test inside. We don't have such thing in Common Lisp as far as I know,
so I had to build it myself.

Fortunately, using [Quicklisp](http://www.quicklisp.org/), the fabulous
equivalent of Python's PyPI, it has been a breeze to set this up.
*cl-openstack-client* just includes a [basic shell
script](https://github.com/stackforge/cl-openstack-client/blob/master/run-tests.sh)
that does the following:

* Download quicklisp.lisp
* Run a [Lisp program to install the dependencies using Quicklisp](https://github.com/stackforge/cl-openstack-client/blob/master/update-deps.lisp)
* Run a [Lisp program running the test suite](https://github.com/stackforge/cl-openstack-client/blob/master/run-tests.lisp) using
[FiveAM](http://common-lisp.net/project/fiveam/), that exit with 0 or 1
based on the tests results.

I just run the test using [SBCL](http://www.sbcl.org), though adding more
compiler on the table would be a really good plan in the future, and should
be straightforward. You can [admire a log from a successful
test](https://jenkins.openstack.org/job/gate-cl-openstack-client-run-tests/4/console)
run done when I proposed a patch via Gerrit, to check what it looks like.

# Implementation status

For the curious, here's an example of how it works:

{% syntax cl %}
* (require 'cl-openstack-client)
* (use-package 'cl-keystone-client)
* (defvar k (make-instance 'connection-v2 :username "demo" :password "somepassword" :tenant-name "demo" :url "http://devstack:5000"))

K

* (authenticate k)

((:ISSUED--AT . "2013-07-04T05:59:55.454226")
 (:EXPIRES . "2013-07-05T05:59:55Z")
 (:ID
  . "wNFQwNzo1OTo1NS40NTQyMthisisaverylongtokenwNFQwNzo1OTo1NS40NTQyM")
 (:TENANT (:DESCRIPTION) (:ENABLED . T)
  (:ID . "1774fd545df4400380eb2b4f4985b3be") (:NAME . "demo")))

* (connection-token-id k)

"wNFQwNzo1OTo1NS40NTQyMthisisaverylongtokenwNFQwNzo1OTo1NS40NTQyM"
{% endsyntax %}

Unfortunately, the implementation is far from being complete. It only
implements for now the Keystone token retrieval.

I've actually started this project to build an already working starting
point. With this, future potential contributors will be able to spend
efforts on writing code, and not on setting up the basic continuous
integration system or module infrastructure.

If you wish to help me and contribute, just follow the [OpenStack Gerrit
workflow howto](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GerritWorkflow) or feel free
to come by me and ask any question (I'm hanging out on #lisp on Freenode
too).

See you soon, hopping to bring more Lisp into OpenStack!
