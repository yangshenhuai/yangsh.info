Recently, I've started programming in [Common Lisp](http://common-lisp.net).

My idea here is to use [cl-irc](http://www.cliki.net/cl-irc), an IRC library
into an [event loop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop). This can be
really useful, for example to trigger action based on time, using timers.

# Creating a connection

The first step is to create a basic *cl-irc:connection* object on our own.
This can be achieved easily with this:

{% syntax cl %}
(require :cl-irc)

(defun connect (server)
  (cl-irc:make-connection :connection-type 'cl-irc:connection
                                              :client-stream t
                                              :network-stream ?
                                              :server-name server))
{% endsyntax %}

This will return a *cl-irc:connection* object, logging to stdout
(*:client-stream t*) and having the server name *server*. Note that the
server name could be any string.

You probably noticed the *?* I used as :network-stream value. This is not a
real and working value: this should be a stream established to the IRC
server you want to chat with. This is where we'll need to use
[<code>cl-async:tcp-connect</code>](http://orthecreedence.github.com/cl-async/tcp#tcp-connect)
to establish a TCP connection.

As you can read in this function's documentation, all we need to pass is the
server address, two callbacks for read and general events, and the *:stream*
option to get a stream rather than a socket.

So you would do something like:

{% syntax cl %}
(require :cl-irc)
(require :cl-async)

(defun connection-socket-read (socket stream)
  (format t "We should read the IRC message from ~a ~%" stream))

(defun connection-socket-event (ev)
  (format t "Socket event: ~a~%" ev))

(defun connect (server &optional (port 6667))
  (cl-irc:make-connection :connection-type 'cl-irc:connection
                          :client-stream t
                          :network-stream (as:tcp-connect server port
                                                          #'connection-socket-read
                                                          #'connection-socket-event
                                                          :stream t)
                          :server-name server))

(as:start-event-loop (lambda () (connect "irc.oftc.net")))
{% endsyntax %}

If you run this program, it will connect to the OFTC IRC server, and then
notice you each time the server is sending you a message.

Therefore our problem here is how we you treat the message read from the
stream in <code>connection-socket-read</code> and handle them in the name of
our connection object you used? We can't link both together at this point.

We can't build a closure, because as the time we use *as:tcp-connect* we
don't have the *cl-irc:connection* instance. Also we can't change easily the
*read-cb* parameter of our *network-stream* established by *as:tcp-connect*,
simply because *cl-async* doesn't use to do allow that.

# Building a closure

So one solution here is to hack *cl-irc:make-connection* so we can build an
*cl-irc:connection* instance without providing in advance the
*network-stream*, allowing us to build a closure including the
*cl-irc:connection* to read event for. This is what we're going to do in the
<code>connect</code> function.

{% syntax cl %}
(require :cl-irc)
(require :cl-async)
(require :flexi-streams)

(defun connection-socket-read (connection)
  (loop for message = (cl-irc::read-irc-message connection)
        while message
        do (cl-irc:irc-message-event connection message)))

(defun connection-socket-event (ev)
  (format t "Socket event: ~a~%" ev))

(defun connect (server port nickname
                &key
                  (username nil)
                  (realname nil)
                  (password nil))
  ;; Build an instance of cl-irc:connection, without any network/output stream
  (let* ((connection (make-instance 'cl-irc:connection
                                    :user username
                                    :password password
                                    :server-name server
                                    :server-port port
                                    :client-stream t))
         ;; Use as:tcp-connect to build our network stream, and build a
         ;; closure calling `connection-socket-read' with our `connection'
         ;; as arguments
         (network-stream (as:tcp-connect server port
                                         (lambda (socket stream)
                                           (declare (ignore socket stream))
                                           (connection-socket-read connection))
                                         #'connection-socket-event
                                         :stream t)))
    ;; Set the network stream on the connection
    (setf (cl-irc:network-stream connection) network-stream)
    ;; Set the output stream on the connection
    (setf (cl-irc:output-stream connection)
         ;; This is grabbed from cl-irc:make-connection
          (flexi-streams:make-flexi-stream
           network-stream
           :element-type 'character
           :external-format '(:utf8 :eol-style :crlf)))

    ;; Now handle the IRC protocol authentication pass
    (unless (null password)
      (cl-irc:pass connection password))
    (cl-irc:nick connection nickname)
    (cl-irc:user- connection (or username nickname) 0 (or realname nickname))
    connection))

(as:start-event-loop (lambda () (connect "irc.oftc.net" 6667 "jd-blog")))
{% endsyntax %}

And here we are! If we run this, we're now using an event loop to run
<code>cl-irc</code>. Each time the socket has something to read, the
function <code>connection-socket-read</code> will be called on the
non-blocking mode socket. If there's no message to be read, then the
function will exit and the loop will continue to run.

# Using timers

You can now modify the last line with this:

{% syntax cl %}
(defun say-hello (connection)
  (cl-irc:privmsg connection "#jd-blog" "Hey I read your blog!")
  (as:delay (lambda () (say-hello connection)) :time 60))

(as:start-event-loop (lambda ()
                       (let ((connection (connect "irc.oftc.net" 6667 "jd-blog")))
                         (cl-irc:join connection "#jd-blog")
                         (say-hello connection))))
{% endsyntax %}

This will connect to the IRC server, join a channel and then say the same
sentence every minute.

Challenge accomplished!

And I'd like to thank [Andrew Lyon](http://blog.killtheradio.net/), the
author of [cl-async](https://github.com/orthecreedence/cl-async), who has
been incredibly helpful with my recent experimentations in this area.
