[CL-JSON](http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-json/) provides an encoder for
Lisp data structures and objects to JSON format. Unfortunately, in some
case, its default encoding mechanism for CLOS objects isn't exactly doing
the right thing. I'll show you how Common Lisp makes it easy to change that.

# Identifying the problem

## CL-JSON & CLOS

*CL-JSON* mechanism encoding CLOS object is really neat. Let's see how it
works for a simple case:

{% syntax cl %}
(defclass kitten ()
  ((tail :initarg :tail)))

(json:encode-json-to-string (make-instance 'kitten :tail 'black))
{% endsyntax %}

will produce:

{% syntax js %}
{"tail":"black"}
{% endsyntax %}

Still using CL-JSON, we can also decode the JSON object to a CLOS object:

{% syntax cl %}
(slot-value
 (json:with-decoder-simple-clos-semantics
   (json:decode-json-from-string "{\"tail\":\"black\"}"))
 :tail)
{% endsyntax %}

That code will return *"black"*. Note that it's also possible to specify
which class should be used when decoding objects, but that's beyond the
purpose of this article.

## Postmodern

Now, let's introduce [Postmodern](http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/postmodern/), a
wonderful Common Lisp system providing access to the wonderful
[PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org) database. It also provides a simple
system to map rows in a database to CLOS classes, called DAO for *Database
access objects*.

With this, we can easily store our *kitten* into a table.

{% syntax cl %}
(defclass kitten ()
  ((tail :initarg :tail))
  (:metaclass postmodern:dao-class))
{% endsyntax %}

If we try to encode this to JSON, it will produce the exact same result seen
previously.

The problem is what happens when one of our column has a *NULL* value.
Postmodern encodes this using the *:null* symbol.

So this code:

{% syntax cl %}
(defclass kitten ()
  ((tail :initarg :tail :col-type (or s-sql:db-null text)))
  (:metaclass postmodern:dao-class))

(postmodern:deftable kitten
  (postmodern:!dao-def))

(postmodern:connect-toplevel …)

(postmodern:create-table 'kitten)

(json:encode-json-to-string
  (postmodern:make-dao 'kitten))
{% endsyntax %}

will return:

{% syntax js %}
"{"tail":"null"}"
{% endsyntax %}

Fail! The fact that the column is *NULL* is represented by the *:null*
symbol. And CL-JSON encodes all symbols as string.

This is not at all what we want here!

# Overriding encode-json

CL-JSON provides and uses the *encode-json* method to encode all kind of
object. It is defined as a *generic function*, and a lot of different
methods are implemented to handle the different standard Common Lisp types.
The one used for *standard-object* is defined liked that:

{% syntax cl %}
(defmethod encode-json ((o standard-object)
                        &optional (stream *json-output*))
  "Write the JSON representation (Object) of the CLOS object O to
STREAM (or to *JSON-OUTPUT*)."
  (with-object (stream)
    (map-slots (stream-object-member-encoder stream) o)))
{% endsyntax %}

All we need to do here, is to create a new method for our *kitten* objects,
that handles correctly the *:null* case.

{% syntax cl %}
(defclass kitten ()
  ((tail :initarg :tail :col-type (or s-sql:db-null text)))
  (:metaclass postmodern:dao-class))

(export 'kitten)

;; Switch package just to define the new method
(in-package :json)
(defmethod encode-json ((o cl-user:kitten)
                        &optional (stream json:*json-output*))
  "Write the JSON representation (Object) of the postmodern DAO CLOS object
O to STREAM (or to *JSON-OUTPUT*)."
  (with-object (stream)
    (map-slots (lambda (key value)
                 (as-object-member (key stream)
                   (encode-json (if (eq value :null) nil value) stream)))
               o)))

;; Go back into our package
(in-package :cl-user)

(postmodern:deftable kitten
  (postmodern:!dao-def))

(postmodern:connect-toplevel …)

(postmodern:create-table 'kitten)

(json:encode-json-to-string
  (postmodern:make-dao 'kitten))
{% endsyntax %}

With that new method, as soon as we encounter a *:null* symbol as a value
for an object's slot, we replace it by *nil*.

Now if we try to encode another *kitten*, we'll get:

{% syntax js %}
{"tail":null}
{% endsyntax %}

which is far better for our JavaScript data consumers!

In the end, I think that this kind of trick is feasible that easily because
of the way CLOS provides its generic method implementation.
The fact that methods don't belong to any class makes the extension of every
program, library and class so much easier. Doing this in another language
like Java would likely by impossible, and in Python it would unlikely be as
clean as it is done in Common Lisp.

The ability to teach *any* library about how it should handle your class
just by defining a new method is really handy!
