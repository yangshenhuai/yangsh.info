Doing code reviews is a great way to discover things that people might
struggle to comprehend. While proof-reading
[OpenStack patches](http://review.openstack.org) recently, I spotted that
people were not using correctly the various decorators Python provides for
methods. So here's my attempt at providing me a link to send them to in my
next code reviews. :-)

# How methods work in Python

A method is a function that is stored as a class attribute. You can declare
and access such a function this way:

{% syntax python %}
>>> class Pizza(object):
...     def __init__(self, size):
...         self.size = size
...     def get_size(self):
...         return self.size
...
>>> Pizza.get_size
<unbound method Pizza.get_size>
{% endsyntax %}

What Python tells you here, is that the attribute *get_size* of the class
*Pizza* is a method that is **unbound**. What does this mean? We'll know as
soon as we'll try to call it:

{% syntax python %}
>>> Pizza.get_size()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unbound method get_size() must be called with Pizza instance as first argument (got nothing instead)
{% endsyntax %}

We can't call it because it's not bound to any instance of *Pizza*. And a
method wants an instance as its first argument (in Python 2 it **must** be
an instance of that class; in Python 3 it could be anything). Let's try to
do that then:

{% syntax python %}
>>> Pizza.get_size(Pizza(42))
42
{% endsyntax %}

It worked! We called the method with an instance as its first argument, so
everything's fine. But you will agree with me if I say this is not a very
handy way to call methods; we have to refer to the class each time we want
to call a method. And if we don't know what class is our object, this is not
going to work for very long.

So what Python does for us, is that it binds all the methods from the class
*Pizza* to any instance of this class. This means that the attribute
*get_size* of an instance of *Pizza* is a bound method: a method for
which the first argument will be the instance itself.

{% syntax python %}
>>> Pizza(42).get_size
<bound method Pizza.get_size of <__main__.Pizza object at 0x7f3138827910>>
>>> Pizza(42).get_size()
42
{% endsyntax %}

As expected, we don't have to provide any argument to *get_size*, since
it's bound, its *self* argument is automatically set to our *Pizza*
instance. Here's a even better proof of that:

{% syntax python %}
>>> m = Pizza(42).get_size
>>> m()
42
{% endsyntax %}

Indeed, you don't even have to keep a reference to your *Pizza* object. Its
method is bound to the object, so the method is sufficient to itself.

But what if you wanted to know which object this bound method is bound to?
Here's a little trick:

{% syntax python %}
>>> m = Pizza(42).get_size
>>> m.__self__
<__main__.Pizza object at 0x7f3138827910>
>>> # You could guess, look at this:
...
>>> m == m.__self__.get_size
True
{% endsyntax %}

Obviously, we still have a reference to our object, and we can find it back
if we want.

In Python 3, the functions attached to a class are not considered as
*unbound method* anymore, but as simple functions, that are bound to an
object if required. So the principle stays the same, the model is just
simplified.

{% syntax python %}
>>> class Pizza(object):
...     def __init__(self, size):
...         self.size = size
...     def get_size(self):
...         return self.size
...
>>> Pizza.get_size
<function Pizza.get_size at 0x7f307f984dd0>
{% endsyntax %}

# Static methods

Static methods are a special case of methods. Sometimes, you'll write code
that belongs to a class, but that doesn't use the object itself at all. For
example:

{% syntax python %}
class Pizza(object):
    @staticmethod
    def mix_ingredients(x, y):
        return x + y

    def cook(self):
        return self.mix_ingredients(self.cheese, self.vegetables)
{% endsyntax %}

In such a case, writing *mix_ingredients* as a non-static method would work
too, but it would provide it a *self* argument that would not be used. Here,
the decorator *@staticmethod* buys us several things:


* Python doesn't have to instantiate a bound-method for each *Pizza* object
we instiantiate. Bound methods are objects too, and creating them has a
cost. Having a static method avoids that:

{% syntax python %}
>>> Pizza().cook is Pizza().cook
False
>>> Pizza().mix_ingredients is Pizza.mix_ingredients
True
>>> Pizza().mix_ingredients is Pizza().mix_ingredients
True
{% endsyntax %}


* It eases the readability of the code: seeing *@staticmethod*, we know that
the method does not depend on the state of object itself;

* It allows us to override the *mix_ingredients* method in a subclass. If we
used a function *mix_ingredients* defined at the top-level of our module, a
class inheriting from *Pizza* wouldn't be able to change the way we mix
ingredients for our pizza without overriding *cook* itself.

# Class methods

Having said that, what are class methods? Class methods are methods that are
not bound to an object, but toâ€¦ a class!

{% syntax python %}
>>> class Pizza(object):
...     radius = 42
...     @classmethod
...     def get_radius(cls):
...         return cls.radius
... 
>>> 
>>> Pizza.get_radius
<bound method type.get_radius of <class '__main__.Pizza'>>
>>> Pizza().get_radius
<bound method type.get_radius of <class '__main__.Pizza'>>
>>> Pizza.get_radius is Pizza().get_radius
True
>>> Pizza.get_radius()
42
{% endsyntax %}

Whatever the way you use to access this method, it will be always bound to
the class it is attached too, and its first argument will be the class
itself (remember that classes are objects too).

When to use this kind of methods? Well class methods are mostly useful for
two types of methods:

* Factory methods, that are used to create an instance for a class using for
example some sort of pre-processing. If we use a *@staticmethod* instead, we
would have to hardcode the *Pizza* class name in our function, making any
class inheriting from *Pizza* unable to use our factory for its own use.

{% syntax python %}
class Pizza(object):
    def __init__(self, ingredients):
        self.ingredients = ingredients

    @classmethod
    def from_fridge(cls, fridge):
        return cls(fridge.get_cheese() + fridge.get_vegetables())
{% endsyntax %}


* Static methods calling static methods: if you split a static methods in
several static methods, you shouldn't hard-code the class name but use class
methods. Using this way to declare ou method, the *Pizza* name is never
directly
referenced and inheritance and method overriding will work flawlessly

{% syntax python %}
class Pizza(object):
    def __init__(self, radius, height):
        self.radius = radius
        self.height = height

    @staticmethod
    def compute_area(radius):
         return math.pi * (radius ** 2)

    @classmethod
    def compute_volume(cls, height, radius):
         return height * cls.compute_area(radius)

    def get_volume(self):
        return self.compute_volume(self.height, self.radius)
{% endsyntax %}

# Abstract methods

An abstract method is a method defined in a base class, but that may not
provide any implementation. In Java, it would describe the methods of an
interface.

So the simplest way to write an abstract method in Python is:

{% syntax python %}
class Pizza(object):
    def get_radius(self):
        raise NotImplementedError
{% endsyntax %}

Any class inheriting from *Pizza* should implement and override the
*get_radius* method, otherwise an exception would be raised.

This particular way of implementing abstract method has a drawback. If you
write a class that inherits from *Pizza* and forget to implement
*get_radius*, the error will only be raised when you'll try to use that
method.

{% syntax python %}
>>> Pizza()
<__main__.Pizza object at 0x7fb747353d90>
>>> Pizza().get_radius()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<stdin>", line 3, in get_radius
NotImplementedError
{% endsyntax %}

There's a way to triggers this way earlier, when the object is being
instantiated, using the [abc](http://docs.python.org/2/library/abc.html)
module that's provided with Python.

{% syntax python %}
import abc

class BasePizza(object):
    __metaclass__  = abc.ABCMeta

    @abc.abstractmethod
    def get_radius(self):
         """Method that should do something."""
{% endsyntax %}

Using *abc* and its special class, as soon as you'll try to instantiate
*BasePizza* or any class inheriting from it, you'll get a *TypeError*.

{% syntax python %}
>>> BasePizza()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class BasePizza with abstract methods get_radius
{% endsyntax %}

# Mixing static, class and abstract methods

When building classes and inheritances, the time will come where you will
have to mix all these methods decorators. So here's some tips about it.

Keep in mind that declaring a method as being abstract, doesn't freeze the
prototype of that method. That means that it must be implemented, but i can be
implemented with any argument list.

{% syntax python %}
import abc

class BasePizza(object):
    __metaclass__  = abc.ABCMeta

    @abc.abstractmethod
    def get_ingredients(self):
         """Returns the ingredient list."""

class Calzone(BasePizza):
    def get_ingredients(self, with_egg=False):
        egg = Egg() if with_egg else None
        return self.ingredients + egg
{% endsyntax %}

This is valid, since *Calzone* fulfil the interface requirement we defined
for *BasePizza* objects. That means that we could also implement it as being
a class or a static method, for example:

{% syntax python %}
import abc

class BasePizza(object):
    __metaclass__  = abc.ABCMeta

    @abc.abstractmethod
    def get_ingredients(self):
         """Returns the ingredient list."""

class DietPizza(BasePizza):
    @staticmethod
    def get_ingredients():
        return None
{% endsyntax %}

This is also correct and fulfil the contract we have with our abstract
*BasePizza* class. The fact that the *get_ingredients* method don't need to know
about the object to return result is an implementation detail, not a
criteria to have our contract fulfilled.

Therefore, you can't force an implementation of your abstract method to be a
regular, class or static method, and arguably you shouldn't. Starting with
Python 3 (this won't work as you would expect in Python 2, see
[issue5867](http://bugs.python.org/issue5867)), it's now possible to use the
*@staticmethod* and *@classmethod* decorators on top of *@abstractmethod*:

{% syntax python %}
import abc

class BasePizza(object):
    __metaclass__  = abc.ABCMeta

    ingredient = ['cheese']

    @classmethod
    @abc.abstractmethod
    def get_ingredients(cls):
         """Returns the ingredient list."""
         return cls.ingredients
{% endsyntax %}

Don't misread this: if you think this going to force your subclasses to
implement *get_ingredients* as a class method, you are wrong. This simply
implies that your implementation of *get_ingredients* in the *BasePizza*
class is a class method.

An implementation in an abstract method? Yes! In Python, contrary to methods
in Java interfaces, you can have code in your abstract methods and call it
via *super()*:

{% syntax python %}
import abc

class BasePizza(object):
    __metaclass__  = abc.ABCMeta

    default_ingredients = ['cheese']

    @classmethod
    @abc.abstractmethod
    def get_ingredients(cls):
         """Returns the ingredient list."""
         return cls.default_ingredients

class DietPizza(BasePizza):
    def get_ingredients(self):
        return ['egg'] + super(DietPizza, self).get_ingredients()
{% endsyntax %}

In such a case, every pizza you will build by inheriting from *BasePizza*
will have to override the *get_ingredients* method, but will be able to use
the default mechanism to get the ingredient list by using *super()*.
