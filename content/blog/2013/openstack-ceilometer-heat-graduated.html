The [OpenStack Technical
Committee](http://www.openstack.org/foundation/technical-committee/) have
voted these last weeks about graduation of
[Heat](https://launchpad.net/heat) and
[Ceilometer](http://launchpad.net/ceilometer), to change their status from
**incubation** to **integrated**.

The details of the discussion can be found in the
[TC IRC meetings logs](http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/meetings/tc/2013/) for
the brave. The results are:

<dl>
  <dt>Approve graduation of Heat (to be integrated in common Havana release)?</dt>
  <dd>yes: 10, abstain: 1, no: 1</dd>
  <dt>Approve graduation of Ceilometer (to be integrated in common Havana release)?</dt>
  <dd>yes: 11, abstain: 1</dd>
</dl>

Therefore both projects have been graduated from *Incubation* to
*Integrated* status. That means that Heat and Ceilometer will be released as
part as OpenStack for the next release cycle *Havana*, due in Autumn 2013.

For people being curious, we the Ceilometer team put up a [nice wiki page
about our status and what we think we were ready to
jump](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Ceilometer/Graduation). For the
curious, The [OpenStack Technical Committee
charter](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Governance/Foundation/TechnicalCommittee)
has some explanations about the incubation and integration process.

# What about Grizzly?

Both projects will be released with Grizzly too, obviously, since they
already follow the release process of OpenStack.

# What about core?

The question that has been raised several times to me is if that means the
projects are becoming *Core* projects. The answer is no, because how to
become a *Core* project is still under discussion and is more a matter for
the *Board of Directors* than the *Technical Committee*. But this is
definitely a step in this direction.

Anyway, from a technical point of view, this means both projects are now
onboard with other OpenStack components so you can enjoy them!
