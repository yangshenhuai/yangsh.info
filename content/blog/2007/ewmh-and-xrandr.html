Today I decided to add some [EWMH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EWMH)
support to [awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org). It now supports a bunch
of this extensions quite nicely.

However, while reading the
[spec](http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-1.4.html) and
writing the code, it appears that this forces a window manager to behave in
only one way: have a poor desktop support, and no multi-head/XRandR/Xinerama
support at all.

The main caveats are that in Xinerama/XRandR mode, you'll have only one root
window. And the root window is where you must store the NET_WM X propertiesâ€¦
So you cannot handle screens in a independant way like *awesome* does. That's
really a shame.

There's also a big problem for window managers like *awesome* which are happy
to draw several desktops at the same time. There's no support for stuff like
that.

So far, I think EWMH is nice but is really too narrow-minded for software
and people who want to think window management in a different way.
