#What you need
You will need a Raspberrypi, a SD card (and card reader) , an ethernet cable and a Wifi USB dongle	
#Flash Respbian on the SD card
you can use [Etcher](https://etcher.io/) to burn [Resbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) to your card.
and after that done , Insert the SD card into your PI,you are ready to rock
#Ssh into your PI with cable
Power on your PI, connect the PI with your router with a normal ethernet cable , and after 1 minute , try execute below command
from the computer that connect to the same router 
{% syntax shell %}
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
(password:raspberrypi)
{% endsyntax %}
Bingo! your are in RPI now!
#Config wifi
Now let's config the wifi setting , so we can throw the ethernet cable away. in RPI add your wifi information in
`/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`
{% syntax shell %}
network={
    ssid="your-network-ssid-name"
    psk="your-network-password"
}
{% endsyntax %}
Attach the wifi USB dongle and unplug the ethernet cable, and reboot the RPI(power off and then power on)
and wait 1 minute , try `ssh pi@raspberrypi.local`.
Now you should be able to login with wifi
