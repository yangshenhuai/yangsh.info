My respberryPI install respbian7 (wheezy). it has python 2.7 and 3.2 by default , but I need python3.6 in order to run the [wxpy](https://github.com/youfou/wxpy) , so I build Python3.6 from source
And I also installed Python3.6 from source in my VPS
{% endmark %}

#Download Python3.6
Download and extract Python source using following command
{% syntax shell %}
cd /usr/src
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.2/Python-3.6.2.tgz
sudo tar xzvf Python-3.6.2.tgz
{% endsyntax %}


#Compile Python Source
Now need some time to compile the python source code, since my SD card in respberrypi is not very good card, it takes me several <b>HOURS</b> to finish
following commands
{% syntax shell %}
cd Python-3.6.2
sudo ./configure
sudo make
sudo make altinstall
{% endsyntax %}
`altinstall` is used to prevent to replace the default python binary in /usr/bin/python 


#Check
And if you finish those command without any error,you can check the version now. By default the pip will also installed with python
{% syntax shell %}
python3.6 -V
    Python 3.6.2
pip3.6 -V
    pip 9.0.1 from /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages (python 3.6)
{% endsyntax %}

And you need to remember to use `python3.6` and `pip3.6` or you can add a link


#Centos6
the first two steps are same. but make sure that your system contains `ssl` module the before your `make`. oherwise when your use `pip install`, it will throw below exception
{% syntax shell %}
pip is configured with locations that require TLS/SSL, however the ssl module in Python is not available.
{% endsyntax %}
you can check which ssl you can get by run below command.
{% syntax shell %}
yum list '*ssl*'
{% endsyntax %}
In centos6  ,it returns several items , and one of them is `openssl-devel` thats what I need. so I run below method to install it
{% syntax shell %}
sudo yum install openssl-devel
{% endsyntax %}

and after python3.6 and pip3.6 installed succcessfully . when I run below method it still give me an error
{% syntax shell %}
[robot@Mr_Robot Python-3.6.2]$ sudo pip3.6 install requests
sudo: pip3.6: command not found
{% endsyntax %}

This is because for security reasons `sudo` does not rely on the $PATH set in your environment,there is a `secure_path` option in `/etc/sudoers` that specifies the PATH that sudo will use for locating binaries. For example
{% syntax shell %}
Defaults    secure_path = /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
{% endsyntax %}
Just add `/usr/local/bin` to this `secure_path` . and it all good!
