{% mark excerpt %}
After Try [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/),I am very impressed by this language.It's very consice and 
expressive, and it's totally interoperable with Java.It provide a lot syntax sugar can help us write less do more
But If you like to stay in Java,[Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) can provide some syntax sugar make life better

#Install
The lombok provide some keyword or annotation to make java easier to write,but it will generate the same
class file as we write regular Java. So we not need lombok when run the application.
For maven , make sure the scope is `provided` and gradle `compileOnly`(since v2.12)
{% syntax shell %}
# For Maven
<dependency>
		<groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
		<artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
		<version>1.16.18</version>
		<scope>provided</scope>
	</dependency>
//For Gradle
dependencies {
	compileOnly 'org.projectlombok:lombok:1.16.18'
}
{% endsyntax %}
And also need to install lombok plugins in your IDE so the IDE doesn't complain the syntax error

#Features

##[val](https://projectlombok.org/features/val)
same as kotlin, but it can only be used to declare the final local variables, and it also infer the type from the initialize expression

##[@Cleanup](https://projectlombok.org/features/Cleanup)
its very useful for closeable resource,its like try-with in Java7
at the end of the scope ,it will generate some code to safely close the resource


##[@Getter/@Setter](https://projectlombok.org/features/GetterSetter)
you can use @Getter/@Setter in class attribute,  it will generate default get and set method
and you can also config the access level etc.

##[@ToString](https://projectlombok.org/features/ToString)
generate the toString using all the field of the class.
you can configure the `includeFieldNames`

##[@Data](https://projectlombok.org/features/Data)
exactly like `data class` in Kotlin

##[@Value](https://projectlombok.org/features/Value)
this is immutable variant of `@Data`, all the field are `private` and `final`

##[@Builder](https://projectlombok.org/features/Builder)
according [Builder pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) produce builder APIs for
your class,you can place on a class or on a constructor.


And there're other useful annotation or keyword,you MUST have a try
