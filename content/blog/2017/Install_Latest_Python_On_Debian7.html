My respberryPI install respbian7 (wheezy). it has python 2.7 and 3.2 by default , but I need python3.6 in order to run the [wxpy](https://github.com/youfou/wxpy) , so I build Python3.6 from source
{% endmark %}
{% endblock %}

#Download Python3.6
Download and extract Python source using following command
{% syntax shell %}
cd /usr/src
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.2/Python-3.6.2.tgz
sudo tar xzvf Python-3.6.2.tgz
{% endsyntax %}


#Compile Python Source
Now need some time to compile the python source code, since my SD card in respberrypi is not very good card, it takes me several <b>HOURS</b> to finish
following commands
{% syntax shell %}s
cd Python-3.6.2
sudo ./configure
sudo make
sudo make altinstall
{% endsyntax %}
`altinstall` is used to prevent to replace the default python binary in /usr/bin/python 


#Check
And if you finish those command without any error,you can check the version now. By default the pip will also installed with python
{% syntax shell %}s
python3.6 -V
    Python 3.6.2
pip3.6 -V
    pip 9.0.1 from /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages (python 3.6)
{% endsyntax %}

And you need to remember to use `python3.6` and `pip3.6` or you can add a link
