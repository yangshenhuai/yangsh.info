It's not that often that I start something from scratch. It's an amazing
feeling to start a new project, to start writing something new. I like
that. It's creation, it's an artistic part of our computing stuff. I feel
like a code artist.

And what I like even more is that little feeling that you are going in an
unknown land. Some area in this tech world where nobody ever came before
you, or only a few pioneers.

That's the sensation I got starting to using
[Cython](http://www.cython.org), [Python 3](http://www.python.org) and
various other tools. I just spent half of my time trying to fix problems,
rather than working on *my* code. Problems in autoconf macro not knowing
Python 2.6 or Python 3.1. Problems and limitations in Cython. And problem in
Python.

That last one was a hard one. I'm still a beginner in the Python world: I
barely know anything. And I was trying to use something nobody never did:
building an embedded Python with a set of built-in modules.

I spent hours trying to find why one type of module importing was badly
failing. I finally found the answer thanks to a guy. who has the same
problem A guy ? No. A pioneer. What do I say? A hero. He's been my
week-hero! Thank you Miguel Lobo because you found the bug I chased for
hours and because you even reported it as [issue
1644818](http://bugs.python.org/issue1644818), including a patch! How not
damn wonderful is that?

I will not bore you with the technical details of that bug, since nobody
cares. Nobody cares, even the Python guys, since that bug has been opened
for 3 years, and nobody even reviewed in that time. I found an old thread
about that bug where some guys were wanking about how they should do the
review, because Miguel pushed for several weeks to have a review, back in
2007.

But that bug was in my way. I had to do something. So I prepared my mail
reader, mounted my web browser and here I was for a uniq quest: getting a
Python bug fixed.

At that point, if you did not stop reading earlier, you might get very
excited. Don't be, spoiler, it's still not fixed. You'll have to wait the
end of the season and see all the episodes I'll have to write to get the end
of the story!

Let's continue.

I had to create an account on the Python bug tracking system. That was a
trivial task for a man like me (you bet). Then, I launched a verbal attack,
something you rarely see in a bug tracking system. Something I knew would
awake any developer caring about their software.


> Julien Danjou:
> Is there any chance to see this *bug* fixed someday?


I had the deep feeling that my quest was starting here. How many days would
I have to wait until I get an answer? Time was passing. Minutes were ticking
while I was waiting, sat in a comfortable sofa in a softly lighted room. It
seemed like all my life was shorter than the delay I had to wait to get an
answer.

After waiting for hours, suddenly, and only 15 minutes later, I got an
answer:

> Martin v. LÃ¶wis:
> Please ask on python-dev. I may be willing to revive my five-for-one offer.

Martin? Don't know that guy. Who is he? Who is he like? Will he fix that
bug? What is this offer? So many question without an answer. But he asked to
ask on python-dev, and I said: challenged accepted! I will write a mail to
python-dev to get that bug fixed.

Which I did. I sent a short (but well written you know, I made efforts)
"WTF?" to pyhon-dev.

And then the guy asked me to review 5 bugs so he will review and fix this
one. And this is how I said that he was pissing me off for blackmailing me
to fix a bug that was its "duty".

Therefore, this is the end of the story so far. Will that bug be fixed some
day? There's a hope, because another guy jumped in and took the bug
assignment.

To be continued.

My conclusion about all that story: that is a little rude to start something
new, with new tools, and get quickly into teething troubles. It's even more
harsh to enter a community because you just found bugs, and be not very well
received when you ask to apply a 10 lines long fix somebody wrote 3 years
ago to fix it.

I'll probably still use Python :-), but I get a darker image of its
community now.
