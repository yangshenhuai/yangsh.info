[cairo](http://www.cairographics.org) has a [Python binding
(pycairo)](http://www.cairographics.org/pycairo/) since a long time, and
some months ago a [Python binding for XCB
(xpyb)](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xcb/xpyb/) has been released.

Pycairo has no support for creating Xlib surfaces. You can get a Xlib
surface from PyGTK and then use Pycairo to draw on it, but there's no way to
create one directly.

What I've done is make Pycairo aware of xpyb so it can creates directly an
XCB surface from a XCB connection and a drawable.

As said in [my mail to the XCB
list](http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xcb/2009-December/005438.html),
I'm now waiting for a review before pushing this upstream. :-)

For the first time, I guess, XCB has beat Xlib support! ;-)
