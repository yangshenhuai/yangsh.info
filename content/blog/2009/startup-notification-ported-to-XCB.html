Since Tuesday, I've begun to work on [XCB](http://xcb.freedesktop.org)
portage of the
[startup-notification](http://www.freedesktop.org/software/startup-notification/)
library.

I've just completed the job, and [send a bunch of patches to the XDG mailing list](http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xdg/2009-January/010176.html).

If the patches are merged, which I don't doubt, I'll be able to use this lib
into [awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org), which would be nice step to the
Freedesktop standard compliance I like to make.
