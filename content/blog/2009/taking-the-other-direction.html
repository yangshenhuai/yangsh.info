I've started to develop [awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org) more than 18
months ago, and somehow I feel it's time to stop a bit and think where we
come from and where we are going to.

# The motivation
I never though I'd be written a window manager one day. That seems kinda
stupid when you see how many window manager there's around.

As many people, I've tested and have been using tons of window manager:
[Window Maker](http://www.windowmaker.info),
[Fluxbox](http://www.fluxbox.org), etc.

In August 2007, I was using [fvwm](http://www.fvwm.org) since 2004 and was
quite happy with it. I used the famous [fvwm
crystal](http://www.fvwm-crystal.org) as a configuration starter and then
rewrote lots of stuff. Digging into ''fvwm'' configuration files was boring,
and since I'm lazy, I never really configured it to fit entirely my needs.

The thing is that, in July 2007, my workstation died. I bought a new one
based on the *amd64* architecture. Too bad, with this new box, *fvwm* decided
that it will not longer runs and was segfaulting almost every time I logged
in.

I was **really** upset. Another failure in the window manager world. So I
decided to get the yearly ride of testing many window managers. I went on
the no more developed stuff like the *boxes, ion3, etc… but well, I did not
like them, there were not powerful enough, too bugged or upstream was
insane.

Then I found [xmonad](http://www.xmonad.org). The Haskell configuration file
format made my cry. I did not want to learn Haskell, it seemed too
obfuscated to me. At that time it was even not packaged for
[Debian](http://www.debian.org), so I gave up. But I found

# The jdwm

I just added a 'j' in front of *dwm* and started to hack it days and nights
to add many feature I missed, like multi-head, etc… On 5th September 2007, I
created a git repository to host my code.

# That's gonna be… awesome.

Five days later, on 10th September, I finally
found a name for my new pet: **awesome**, borrowed from [Barney
Stinson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_Stinson) who heavily uses and
abuses this word.

## The 1.x branch

The first releases until December were noted 1.x. It was just a better *dwm*
with a simple flat configuration file.. The configuration file used
[libconfig](http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/), but it was a very poor
choice. And I was not able to put in into Debian because of
[name clash](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=441200).

## The 2.x branch

The 2.x branch came in January 2008 with a brand new configuration file
format based on [libconfuse](http://www.nongnu.org/confuse/), which was a
bit more powerful. Many concepts and features that have been added in this
branch are still used in the current 3.x branch.

At this time, between December 2007 and April 2008, the community was
growing smoothly.

But as I said, awesome 2 was based on a flat configuration file. That raised
a problem very soon: users expectation were growing and the development team
(me and a couple of regular contributors) was unable to cope with them.

One of the event that started to change my mind was the support for
titlebars.

When I've added titlebar support, it was minimal. It was on top of a window,
with the window title. Dot. Then I've started to add a lot of options, like
the application icon drawing, the position (left, right, bottom) etc.

And then users started to ask for more, like: "add titlebar on windows only
when the window is floating".

That's ok, but that's complicated: that's again **another** option to do some
stuff conditionally. And then, why don't add titlebar on windows when
<insert random events here>?

## The 3.x branch

### Why

At that time, around April 2008, I'd totally stopped development. I was
trying to find a solution which was simple and powerful. But after 2 weeks
of thinking, I was not able to find anything else than: use a real language
for configuration.

So, I've started prototyping awesome 3 using [Lua](http://www.lua.org). The
choice was not obvious, and despite the problem *Lua* might suffer, it's one
of the easiest language to integrate into an existing application.

But, let's go a little back: in January 2008, Arnaud Fontaine contacted me
because he was interested to use *awesome* as one of its school project. He
decided to port *awesome* from *Xlib* to
*[XCB](http://xcb.freedesktop.org)*, a modern asynchronous X library.

His work took some time, but in May 2008, Arnaud did finished to port git
master version of *awesome* to use *XCB*.

Consequently, I decided to start a new major branch, using *XCB* instead of
*Xlib* (no change for users in this regard) and *Lua* instead of our previous
flat configuration file format.

### Development

It took me a while to get from here to there, but in September 2008, it was
ready. We had a simple Lua API, and the XCB port was working perfectly.

It took us some time to release and have something totally working, because
we had to work on *XCB* and contribute back to the project. It was really not
ready to use by an application, but we did great work in this area and it's
now really fine.

### We're still here

Releases continue to happens, 3.1 around December 2008, and 3.2 around March
2009. 3.3 should be here in June.

One of the drawback we had, is that we moved many stuff from C to Lua. Why?
Because writing things in Lua is quicker and easier to maintain than C, and
makes thing more configurable for the user.

For example, the layout algorithm used to organize window were written in C
until 3.2 came out. At that time, users had no choice than using a set of
predefined layout to organize their windows.

Starting with 3.2, if they have minimal knowledge about geometry, they can
start writing a layout function organising windows on the screen.

But this kind of API changes was a bit rough for users, since they had to
port some part of their configuration file to the new API.  The thing is
that the project was still a *teenager* at that time, not really knowing were
it will go. But I'm happy to announce that API breakage are more and more
rare (so far only one minor between 3.2 and 3.3), and anyway always for the
Good.

But I admit that it built a bad reputation around *awesome 3.x* during its
first month of existence.

# Future direction

I am currently working on 3.3 development. We have still many things to do.
Time passing, we get more idea, and more users. And more users bring more
ideas. We also have many more contributors, and some guys are even taking
maintainer-ship of some code area.

# Conclusion
My post title is "Taking the other direction" because I feel this way.

I've got that feeling that some approaches in projects like GNOME are
sometimes bad. Please don't misread me, I know we are not playing in the
same yard.

When adding a key shortcut for starting an application makes you dig into
*gconf*, I wonder how this is a win for the user.

Well, it's probably a win for the end-user, but I surely am not one of
them. And I don't intend to target them with my software, anyway.

And now, when I hear things like GNOME 3.0 and the "[desktop shell](http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell])" approach, that makes me smile.
Guys, it was time, but have luck. What I see from here, is that any desktop
control interface is wrong somehow, and that there's no approach that can
fulfill all users wishes.

I think that we, the awesome development team (no pun intended) took the
direction of building a frame-work window manager rather than a solution
written in marble.

We (partially) solved the issue of UI ergonomic by not writing one and
allowing the user to write his own. I don't say that's easy to do for most
of users, but it's doable.

And I think it's worth it: I use window managers since I use Linux, around
1998. If something like ''awesome'' came 5 years ago, I'd be using it so
far, because you can write *Fluxbox* or *WindowMaker* using *awesome* in a hundred
of Lua code. And you can write your own version of it. And it starts in less
than 3 seconds, supporting almost all standard desktop specification (ICCCM,
EWMH, XDG, system tray, message notification, D-Bus, etc), whereas many of
the window mangers do not.

You can even write and play [space
invaders](http://awesome.naquadah.org/apidoc/modules/invaders.html).

Finally, I'm happy about the the road we took so far, and hope we will
continue into that direction. The rants I read about our project are not
that big, compared to the kudos we received.
