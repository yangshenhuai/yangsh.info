Since several month, [awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org) users have
reported a bug with [OpenOffice.org](http://www.openoffice.org). When using
OOo and clicking on a menu, or using the mouse wheel to read a document, the
currently selected tag (desktop) will change automagically to another one.

I've digged into awesome and found that awesome received a
_NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP request. As defined by
[EWMH](http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-latest.html#id2550663),
this kind of request are sent by a pager to change the active desktop.

That was weird. Nobody is using a pager here. So, I just kicked my gdb out,
attached it to OOo, breaking on *XSendEvent* call. And I got it:

I started digging more into the code, and this is what I finally found in
*salframe.cxx*:

<pre>
        // #i45160# switch to desktop where a dialog with parent will appear
        if( mpParent && mpParent->m_nWorkArea != m_nWorkArea )
            GetDisplay()->getWMAdaptor()->switchToWorkArea(mpParent->m_nWorkArea );
</pre>

Beautiful! It even has a comment with a IssueZilla bug number. Let's go and
see where it comes from.

After 10 minutes of research to find that fucking IZ, I finally found the
link to the [issue #45160](http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=45160). The bug is
IMHO not related to OOo but to a window manager doing poor job.

I've found that an awesome user already reported an bugâ€¦ err, wait, I mean
an issue as [issue #96684](http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=96684) (remember
there's no bug in OOo, only issues) and I commented about it.

It seems OOo developers have agreed to fix that bug eventually.
