Last year, I told you I wanted to use
[Sieve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_(mail_filtering_language)) to
filter my mail. I did not switch, because of the lacking implementation of
some Sieve features inside [Dovecot](http://www.dovecot.org), my preferred
IMAP server.

After that disapointement, I kept my 8 years old mail setup, being *fetchmail*
running on my workstation and throwing the mails in *procmail*, then using
*mutt* locally to read the maildirs. But that's over.

I got a laptop to replace my workstation. It was not possible to continue
using such a mail setup, since my laptop can be offline, and so would be my
mails.

So I decided to upgrade Dovecot to 1.2. I used the *dovecot-1.2-work*
Subversion branch of our lovely Debian maintainers, and built a Debian
package for Lenny. The upgrade from 1.1 was almost painless, since the
configuration file did not change heavily.

Then I started to write my little Sieve script. Sieve is a very nice
language. Almost user friendly. So in 20 lines I rewrote all my procmail
stuff, matching things like *List-Id* with regex to put the mails
automagically in the right folder. I reconfigured *mutt* to use IMAP, and it
works fine. I even reimported my old Maildir via IMAP using *mutt* too.

I am now a happy IMAP user.

For people wondering why I wanted to switch away from *procmail* to *Sieve*: the
reason is that Sieve script can be uploaded remotely via *managesieve*. This
means you do not need FTP/SSH/whatever access to put your script. You can,
for example, use *connect-sieve* or the Sieve plugin for Thunderbird/Icedove.
