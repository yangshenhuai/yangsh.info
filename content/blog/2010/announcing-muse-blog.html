Digging into the fabulous world of Emacs and Lisp, I wanted to use it to
build my personal Web site and my blog.

I already moved from [ikiwiki](http://ikiwiki.info/) to [Emacs
Muse](http://mwolson.org/projects/EmacsMuse.html) for my HTML pages some weeks
ago.

Muse provides an extension to maintain a journal, called
*muse-journal*. Unfortunately, it was far to fulfill all my needs, and I
decided that it would be a good exercise to write a better extension.

Consequently, I started to wrote my own extension, which I named
[muse-blog](http://julien.danjou.info/muse-blog.html).

And this is now what is used to build this blog. :-)
