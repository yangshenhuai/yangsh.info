Even if [I recently stated I lost some of my
faith]({{site.url}}/blog/2010/thoughts-and-rambling-on-the-X-protocol)
in [XCB](http://xcb.freedesktop.org), I still sometimes hack things to add
support for it.

These last days, I've worked on a [D-Bus](http://dbus.freedesktop.org) port from Xlib to XCB. The port was
quite straight forward, since there's only a little piece of D-Bus using X,
which is *dbus-launch*.

I though D-Bus was a good candidate, since it's part of the [Freedesktop](http://www.freedesktop.org)
initiative. Therefore, I was expecting a warm welcome and some enthusiasm
from a fellow project.

My contribution got one useful review, and a [cold reply from Thiago Macieira](http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dbus/2010-July/013185.html)
(a [KDE](http://www.kde.org)/[Qt](http://qt.nokia.com)/[Nokia](http://www.nokia.com) developer):

This is not really the kind of answer I expected, actually. I then reworked
the code to [please Thiago](http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dbus/2010-July/013192.html), and added some *#ifdef* to add XCB support to
D-Bus, with a fallback to libx11 where XCB would not be available.

[Havoc Pennington replied](http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dbus/2010-July/013196.html):

The last part "Maybe people should be thinking about porting xcb to
non-Linux platforms?" is still unclear to me, even though
[I asked Havoc to explain what he meant](http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dbus/2010-July/013197.html).

Finally, [Thiago refused to merge the patch](http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dbus/2010-July/013198.html):

I can't disagree with that conclusion: using both XCB and X11 make the code
unreadable for little gain. That's why I did replace libx11 by XCB directly
in the first version of the patch. On the other hand, D-Bus people does not
seems to really care about making their software evolve in the right
direction, even if that requires users to upgrade their systems.

I think D-Bus using and depending on XCB would have been a good point to
push adoption of XCB. Unfortunately, it seems you can't even rely of
projects of the same initiative (i.e. Freedesktop) to work together to make
things a little bit better.

After 5 years of existence, XCB is still not so obvious to people, and
making it adopt is going to be a challenge for the next years. The upside is
that [new X.org 7.6 will bring XCB with it](http://www.x.org/wiki/Releases/7.6), as part of the katamari.
