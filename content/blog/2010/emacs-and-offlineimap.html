I recently decided to use
[OfflineIMAP](http://wiki.github.com/jgoerzen/offlineimap/) to synchronize
my mails on my laptop. It's a great piece of software, and allows me to read
my mail while I'm offline.

I use it with [Gnus](http://www.gnus.org), of course. But I lacked a proper way to integrate
OfflineIMAP with it, so I decided to write a little Emacs extension to run
and monitor OfflineIMAP directly from Emacs.

Here comes [offlineimap.el](http://julien.danjou.info/software/offlineimap.el), an Emacs extension to run OfflineIMAP directly
within Emacs. It will display OfflineIMAP output in a buffer, and optionally
shows the current OfflineIMAP operation in the mode line.

By default the status is in the mode line only if you are in the Gnus group
buffer. But that's customizable, of course, since this is Emacs!

If you are using [el-get](http://github.com/dimitri/el-get), there's already a recipe to install it!
