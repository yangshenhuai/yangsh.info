[rainbow-mode](http://julien.danjou.info/software/rainbow-mode) had a big
success and good feedbacks when I released it for the first time a couple of
months ago.

Several users asked to me request its inclusion into [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). Therefore, some
days ago, [I proposed to merge it inside Emacs trunk](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2010-07/msg01290.html). My request has been
denied, but the mode has been added to the [Emacs 24 package repository](http://elpa.gnu.org).

In the mean time, I've added support for [hsl() and hsla()](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#hsl-color) support, and added
[CSS 3/SVG color names](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#svg-color).
