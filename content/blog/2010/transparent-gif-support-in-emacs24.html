Last week, I wrote a [couple of patches](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2010-10/msg01009.html) to add support for transparency when Emacs is displaying [GIF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format) images.

Until now, it was displaying the color used to define transparency in the
file data. Now it displays the image correctly by using the frame color as
the transparency color, like it's done for other image formats.

The patches have not been merged yet, but will probably be soon.
