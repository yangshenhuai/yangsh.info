This last weeks, I've worked on implementing the
[Desktop Notification Specification](http://www.galago-project.org/specs/notification/) into [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).

{% endmark %}

It allows sending desktop notification in a very simple way.

{% syntax cl %}
(notifications-notify
    :title "You've got mail!"
    :body "There's 34 mails unread"
    :app-icon "~/.emacs.d/icons/mail.png"
    :urgency 'low)
{% endsyntax %}

It supports the protocol signals (*NotificationClosed* and *ActionInvoked*) and
the two main methods (*Notify* and *CloseNotification*).

The methods specification are implemented entirely (hints, replaces,
actions, icon, etc).

The signals are supported via callbacks function provided on the
notification creation.

It have been merged into Emacs trunk today.

	* net/notifications.el: New file.

{% endsyntax %}

This also allowed me to discover, raise and fix a
[bug](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2010-06/msg00228.html)
in the D-Bus binding of Emacs, which will be probably fixed in trunk soon.
