Last week, I worked on my
[Google Maps for Emacs](http://julien.danjou.info/google-maps-el.html)
extension. I've introduced a new format handling for locations which include
the longitude and latitude. The initial format was just a string describing
the location, which was obviously too limited.

{% endmark %}

It now prints coordinates of the different elements when the mouse is over
the map, with other information.

It also center the map on *M-x google-maps* and set a default zoom level. This
is something which was not set because it's not a good idea to set center
coordinates in order to see all points on the map automatically. But you can
still remove the centering by pressing *"C"*. On the other hand, setting it
automatically allows to move the map easily, and I think that what most
users want to do.

I've also added a "place my home on the map" feature, accessible by pressing
*"h"* on any map. That adds a marker according to the location set in Emacs
using the *calendar-* variables.

This feature is also available under [[http://orgmode.org][Org]] by pressing *C-u C-c M-l*, which
shows the location of your appointment with your home on the map too.

Finally, you also get caching so it does not request images you already
seen, which makes the moving nicer and faster to use, and prompt history.
