Since I have started to use [Org-mode](http://www.orgmode.org), I though it was missing something to
have appointment locations on a map. Of course, it's easy to get a *LOCATION*
property from an entry, and then *browse-url* on [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com).

But it is **too** easy for me, so once again I said: challenge accepted! I will
bring Google Maps into Emacs!

After several hours of work, the [google-maps.el project](http://julien.danjou.info/software/google-maps.el) shows a map!

It fully implements the [Google Static Maps API](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/staticmaps/) and the
[Google Maps Geocoding API](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/geocoding/).

You can type **M-x google-maps** and type some place to see it marked on map. Of
course you can do much more, as seen in the screen shot above.

I've also completed all of this with a small *org-location-google-maps.el* which
simply show a Google Maps' map for the location of an event in *Org mode* by
pressing C-c M-l in an Org buffer or in the Org agenda.
