The Debian package of [Emacs Muse](http://mwolson.org/projects/EmacsMuse.html) was maintained by [Michael W. Wolson](http://mwolson.org/web/WelcomePage.html), who is
also the upstream author of that software.

[He announced months ago that Muse needed a new upstream maintainer.](http://blog.mwolson.org/tech/projects/emacs_muse_3.20_released.html) That's
not something I'm willing to do, since I really think Muse has been
superseded by [Org mode](http://www.orgmode.org) nowadays.

However, I'm still using Muse to maintain this blog with my [muse-blog](http://julien.danjou.info/software/muse-blog)
extension, since Org still lacks some infrastructure to maintain and publish
a blog.

Therefore, I adopted the [Emacs Muse Debian package](http://packages.qa.debian.org/m/muse-el.html) and updated it to the
latest version!
