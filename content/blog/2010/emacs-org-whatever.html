Another week, another [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) extension!

{% endmark %}

I had (once again) a wonderful idea: what if I could have the weather
forecasts in my [Org](http://orgmode.org) agenda? Wouldn't that be wonderful?

My quest started by looking for a service offering a good weather forecast
API. I found nothing simple as the hidden Google Weather API, which is nice,
butâ€¦ not documented. Not at all. Not a single line. Nah.

Then, I wrote a **google-weather** extension, implementing a basic Emacs Lisp
API to retrieve data from the Google service:

{% syntax cl %}
ELISP> (google-weather-data->forecast (google-weather-get-data "Paris"))
(((9 8 2010)
  (low "53")
  (high "63")
  (icon "http://www.google.com/ig/images/weather/rain.gif")
  (condition "Rain"))
 ((9 9 2010)
  (low "53")
  (high "69")
  (icon "http://www.google.com/ig/images/weather/chance_of_rain.gif")
  (condition "Scattered Showers"))
 ((9 10 2010)
  (low "54")
  (high "72")
  (icon "http://www.google.com/ig/images/weather/partly_cloudy.gif")
  (condition "Partly Cloudy"))
 ((9 11 2010)
  (low "55")
  (high "75")
  (icon "http://www.google.com/ig/images/weather/partly_cloudy.gif")
  (condition "Partly Cloudy")))
{% endsyntax %}

My API even implements data caching, which is nice to speed up the agenda
display.

By the way, I think my next job will be to hack on the *url-cache* feature of
Emacs, which is utterly buggy and has probably never be used. But that's
another topic.

Finally, I just had to write another module on top of that to export the
forecasts to Org. A screen shot is probably better than a long and boring
explanation, so here's the result.

My only regret is that the icons provided by Google are ugly squares, so I
did not want to use them. On the other hand, I did not found any icon set
that would have all the icons Google provides (around 20). So I felt back on
the [icon naming specification](http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-latest.html) to map the Google images to standard images.
Any better idea would be welcome, of course.

All the information can be found on the
[Google Weather for Emacs extension homepage](http://julien.danjou.info/software/google-weather.el).
