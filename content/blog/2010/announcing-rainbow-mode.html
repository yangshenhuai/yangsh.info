While customizing [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) this last weeks, I had the need to customize also
the color theme.

Color themes are always a pain in the ass to edit, because you're supposed
to read color strings like *#aabbcc* and guess what colors they represent.

This is why I wrote *[[http://julien.danjou.info/rainbow-mode.html][rainbow-mode]]*, a minor mode for Emacs that will highlight
strings that represents color, using the color they represent.

This support hexadecimal syntax, HTML color name, X color names and rgb()
CSS syntax.
