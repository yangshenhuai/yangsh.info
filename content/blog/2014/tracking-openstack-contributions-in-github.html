I've switched my Git repositories to [GitHub](https://github.com) recently,
and started to watch my contributions statistics, which were very low
considering I spend my days hacking on open source software, especially
[OpenStack](https://openstack.org).

OpenStack hosts its Git repositories on its own infrastructure at
[git.openstack.org](http://git.openstack.org), but also mirrors them on
GitHub. Logically, I was expecting GitHub to track my commits there too, as
I'm using the same email address everywhere.

It turns out that it was not the case, and the
[help page about that](https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile)
on GitHub describes the rule in place to compute statistics. Indeed,
according to GitHub, I had no relations to the OpenStack repositories, as I
never forked them nor opened a pull request on them (OpenStack uses
[Gerrit](http://review.openstack.org)).

Starring a repository is enough to build a relationship between a user and a
repository, so this is was the only thing needed to inform GitHub that I
have contributed to those repositories. Considering OpenStack has hundreds
of repositories, I decided to star them all by using a small Python script
using [pygithub](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pygithub).

<div class="clear">
   <script
   src="https://gist.github.com/jd/20d2ffd4b1e6ce3a8b07.js"></script>
</div>

And voil√†, [my statistics](https://github.com/jd) are now including all my
contributions to OpenStack!
