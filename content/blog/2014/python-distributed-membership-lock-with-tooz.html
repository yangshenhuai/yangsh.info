With [OpenStack](http://openstack.org) embracing the
[Tooz](http://launchpad.net/python-tooz) library more and more over the past
year, I think it's a good start to write a bit about it.

# A bit of history

A little more than year ago, with my colleague Yassine Lamgarchal and others at
[eNovance](http://enovance.com), we investigated on how to solve a problem often
encountered inside OpenStack: synchronization of multiple distributed workers.
And while many people in our ecosystem continue to drive development by adding
new bells and whistles, we made a point of solving new problems with a generic
solution able to address the technical debt at the same time.

Yassine wrote the first ideas of what should be the
[group membership service](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Oslo/blueprints/service-sync)
that was needed for OpenStack, identifying several projects that could make use
of this. I've presented this concept during the
[OpenStack Summit in Hong-Kong](https://www.openstack.org/summit/openstack-summit-hong-kong-2013/)
during an Oslo session. It turned out that the idea was well-received, and the
week following the summit we started the
[tooz](http://launchpad.net/python-tooz) project on
[StackForge](http://ci.openstack.org/stackforge.html).

# Goals

Tooz is a Python library that provides a coordination API. Its primary goal is to
handle groups and membership of these groups in distributed systems.

Tooz also provides another useful feature which is distributed locking. This
allows distributed nodes to acquire and release locks in order to synchronize
themselves (for example to access a shared resource).

# The architecture

If you are familiar with distributed systems, you might be thinking that there
are a lot of solutions already available to solve these issues:
[ZooKeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/), the
[Raft consensus algorithm](http://raftconsensus.github.io/) or even
[Redis](http://redis.io/) for example.

You'll be thrilled to learn that Tooz is not the result of the
[NIH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here) syndrome, but is an
abstraction layer on top of all these solutions. It uses drivers to provide the
real functionalities behind, and does not try to do anything fancy.

All the drivers do not have the same amount of functionality of robustness, but
depending on your environment, any available driver might be suffice. Like most
of OpenStack, we let the deployers/operators/developers chose whichever backend
they want to use, informing them of the potential trade-offs they will make.

So far, Tooz provides drivers based on:

- [Kazoo](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/kazoo) (ZooKeeper)
- [Zake](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zake)
- [memcached](http://memcached.org)
- [redis](http://redis.io)
- [SysV IPC](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/lpg/node21.html) (only for distributed locks for now)
- [PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org) (only for distributed locks for now)
- [MySQL](http://mysql.org) (only for distributed locks for now)

All drivers are distributed across processes. Some can be distributed across the
network (ZooKeeper, memcached, redisâ€¦) and some are only available on the same
host (IPC).

Also note that the Tooz API is completely asynchronous, allowing it to be more
efficient, and potentially included in an event loop.

# Features

## Group membership

    style="max-width: 7%;">

Tooz provides an API to manage group membership. The basic operations provided
are: the creation of a group, the ability to join it, leave it and list its
members. It's also possible to be notified as soon as a member joins or leaves a
group.

## Leader election

    class="illustration pull-right"
    style="max-width: 7%;">

Each group can have a leader elected. Each member can decide if it wants to run
for the election. If the leader disappears, another one is elected from the list
of current candidates. It's possible to be notified of the election result and
to retrieve the leader of a group at any moment.

## Distributed locking

    style="max-width: 7%;">

When trying to synchronize several workers in a distributed environment, you may
need a way to lock access to some resources. That's what a distributed lock can
help you with.

# Adoption in OpenStack

[Ceilometer](http://launchpad.net/ceilometer) is the first project in OpenStack
to use Tooz. It has replaced part of the old alarm distribution system, where
RPC was used to detect active alarm evaluator workers. The group membership
feature of Tooz was leveraged by Ceilometer to coordinate between alarm
evaluator workers.

Another new feature part of the Juno release of Ceilometer is the distribution
of polling tasks of the central agent among multiple workers. There's again a group
membership issue to know which nodes are online and available to receive polling
tasks, so Tooz is also being used here.

The [Oslo](http://wiki.openstack.org/Oslo) team
[has accepted the adoption of Tooz](https://review.openstack.org/#/c/122439/)
during this release cycle. That means that it will be maintained by more
developers, and will be part of the OpenStack release process.

This opens the door to push Tooz further in OpenStack. Our next candidate would
be write a service group driver for [Nova](http://launchpad.net/nova).

The [complete documentation for Tooz is available online](http://tooz.rtfd.org/)
and has examples for the various features described here, go read it if you're
curious and adventurous!
