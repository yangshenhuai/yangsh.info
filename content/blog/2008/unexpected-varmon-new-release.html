This has been 4 years since I released a new upstream release of
[VARMon](http://julien.danjou.info/software/varmon), the DAC960
administration tool.

There was a bug first discovered in
[#401236](http://bugs.debian.org/401236). It has been fixed in Debian with
an ugly fix, which did not work finally for a long time. Recently
[#491505](http://bugs.debian.org/491505) got opened too, which was the same
as the previous one. But this time I got access to hardware, thanks to
Christoph! And I finally fixed the bug. I've even be able to test the fixes
I wrote years ago for all of the compilation warnings.

That's a shame that the problem was caused by dead code from the previous
upstream, and that I did not realize that sooner. Kids, do not let dead
debug code in your program at home.

So I've finally been able to release a new 1.2.1 version which maybe the
last release for the next decade! ;-)
