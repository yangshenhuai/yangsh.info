Ben Armstrong opened an [ITP for the ATL1E NIC
driver](http://bugs.debian.org/492029), which is found on some Asus EeePC
laptops. So, as suggested by Maximilian Attems, [I provided a clean patch
for this
driver](http://lists.debian.org/debian-kernel/2008/07/msg00638.html), made
from a cherry-pick from the linux-netdev 2.6.27 tree. It has been committed
into the 2.6.26-1 Debian kernel, which will be furnished with Lenny.

What's fun, is that in the mean time, I got a new computer at work. Wait,
it's not fun yet. Because what I did not know is that it's made of an
[Asus P5Q motherboard](http://asus.com/products.aspx?l1=3&l2=11&l3=709&l4=0&model=2164&modelmenu=1)
which runs a NIC needing the ATL1E driver (and now you see why it's fun).

So I've just upgraded to 2.6.26-1-amd64 and I'm glad that my own work is
useful to me (and will be probably be to others as well). :-)
