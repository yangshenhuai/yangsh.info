I've started using [Lua](http://www.lua.org) some months ago, while looking
for a more powerful way to configure [awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org).
At this time, around March 2008, Lua seemed to be the best language to
integrate inside the core system of *awesome*.

I still think that Lua was a good choice, but after 8 months, it shows some
important drawbacks.

I'll try to keep my explanation simple and to make you understand
everything, even if you do not know Lua.

I refer here to Lua version 5.1.

# Design flaws

## Length operator

Lua has a length operator on its objects, known as ''#''. It can be used to
get the size of various objects.

{% syntax lua %}
> return #"lol"
> 3
{% endsyntax %}

This operator works for table, string, etcâ€¦ It's possible to define this
operator by setting a *__len* meta-method on a userdata value.

The problem is that you cannot redefine it on string or table objects, see:

{% syntax lua %}
> a = { "hello", "world" }
> return #a
2
> setmetatable(a, { __len = function () return 18 end })
> return #a
2
{% endsyntax %}

Indeed, looking at the Lua core code:
{% syntax c %}
      case OP_LEN: {
        const TValue *rb = RB(i);
        switch (ttype(rb)) {
          case LUA_TTABLE: {
            setnvalue(ra, cast_num(luaH_getn(hvalue(rb))));
            break;
          }
          case LUA_TSTRING: {
            setnvalue(ra, cast_num(tsvalue(rb)->len));
            break;
          }
          default: {  /* try metamethod */
            Protect(
              if (!call_binTM(L, rb, luaO_nilobject, ra, TM_LEN))
                luaG_typeerror(L, rb, "get length of");
            )
          }
        }
        continue;
      }
{% endsyntax %}

You clearly see that tables and strings always use the internal length
operator, never the *__len* meta-method.

That's for me a design problem, which will cause more trouble. We'll see
later.

## index and newindex metamethods

Lua defines two useful meta-methods, which are *__index* and *__newindex*. Both
can be set on a table or any other object.  *__index* will be called upon each
read access to an undefined key on an object, and *__newindex* upon each write
access.

{% syntax lua %}
> a = {}
> -- function are not defined, this is just an example
> setmetatable(a, { __index = myindexfunction, __newindex = mynewindexfunction })
> a[1] = "hello" -- This will call __newindex metamethod
> return a[2] -- This will call __index metamethods
> return a[1] -- This will NOT call __index
{% endsyntax %}

The last line does not call *__index* meta-method because *a[1]* does
exists. This is a problem when you want to use table as object, because
sometimes you want to monitor access to the table elements.

This can be easily worked around using a proxy system: you don't store
things in the table you manipulate, but in another table.


{% syntax lua %}
> a = {}
> realtable = {}
> -- function are not defined, this is just an example:
> setmetatable(a, { __index = myindexfunction, __newindex = mynewindexfunction })
{% endsyntax %}

Where meta-methods are something like:

{% syntax lua %}
function myindexfunction(table, key)
   return realtable[key]
end

function mynewindexfunction(table, key, value)
   realtable[key] = value
end
{% endsyntax %}

This way, our *a* table will always be empty, and *realtable* will have the
data. At every read or write access to *a*, the meta-methods will be
called. This is very convenient and widely used hack.

But this has serious drawbacks: as we saw before, the length operator (*#*)
cannot be redefined on a table. That means *#a* will always be 0, and you
cannot get the table length anymore, except by defining another method or a
special attribute.

Also, Lua has several functions in the *table* library that are used to
manipulate table in a easy way. The problem is that standard functions like
*table.insert* or *table.remove* do raw accesses to the table. Meaning that if
you do *table.insert(a, 1, 1)* it will insert the value 1 at the key 1 into *a*,
**without** calling the *__newindex* meta-methods, breaking all your beautiful
object-oriented model.

Another solution is to use a userdata object, like done in the Lua *newproxy*
function (which is under-documented).

The problem is that it breaks all the other functions that are waiting for a
table as argument, because they see a userdata, not a table. So this time
*table.insert* is now more usable, which somehow fixes the problem, but not in
the right way IMHO.  However, this allows to use the *__len* meta-method.

# Development model

The development model of Lua is, from my point of view, non-existent.

There is no public version control system repository available, so there's
no chance to really contribute to Lua. It seems only a defined set of people
work on it and therefore, the development system is very closed to my eyes,
in comparison of usual projects.

# Conclusion

I still think Lua is a good choice, because it is very easy to integrate
into any C program, and to expand to fulfill your needs. However, some bad
design choices were made, and the poor and closed development model chosen
does not allow to have a good overview of the future of Lua.

This has been [well stated by the authors
themselves](http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2008-06/msg00407.html).
