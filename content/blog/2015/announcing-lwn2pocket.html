I've started to use [Pocket](https://pocket.co) a few months ago to store my
backlog of things to read. It's especially useful as I can use it to read
content offline since we still don't have any Internet access in places such
as airplanes or the Paris metro. It's only 2015 after all.

I am also a [LWN.net](http://lwn.net) subscriber for years now, and I really
like their articles from the weekly edition. Unfortunately, as the access is
restricted to subscribers, you need to login: it makes it impossible to add
these articles to Pocket directly. Sad.

Yesterday, I thought about that and decided to start hacking on it. LWN
provides a feature called "Subscriber Link" that allows you to share an article
with a friend. I managed to use that feature to share the articles with my
friendâ€¦ Pocket!

As doing that every week is tedious, I wrote a small Python program called
[lwn2pocket](https://github.com/jd/lwn2pocket) that I published on
[GitHub](http://github.com). Feel free to use it, hack it and send pull
requests.
