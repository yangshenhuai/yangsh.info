Recently, I've been fighting with the never ending issue of timezones. I never
thought I would have plunged into this rabbit hole, but hacking on OpenStack
and Gnocchi I felt into that trap easily is, thanks to Python.

## “Why you really, really, should never ever deal with timezones”

To get a glimpse of the complexity of timezones, I recommend that you watch
[Tom Scott](http://www.tomscott.com/)'s video on the subject. It's fun and it
summarizes remarkably well the nightmare that timezones are and why you should
stop thinking that you're smart.

## The importance of timezones in applications

</div>

Once you've heard what Tom says, I think it gets pretty clear that a timestamp
without any timezone attached does not give any useful information. It should
be considered irrelevant and useless. Without the necessary context given by
the timezone, you cannot infer what point in time your application is really
referring to.

That means your application should never handle timestamps with no timezone
information. It should try to guess or raises an error if no timezone is
provided in any input.

Of course, you can infer that having no timezone information means UTC. This
sounds very handy, but can also be dangerous in certain applications or
language – such as Python, as we'll see.

Indeed, in certain applications, converting timestamps to UTC and losing the
timezone information is a terrible idea. Imagine that a user create a recurring
event every Wednesday at 10:00 in its local timezone, say CET. If you convert
that to UTC, the event will end up being stored as every Wednesday at 09:00.

Now imagine that the CET timezone switches from UTC+01:00 to UTC+02:00: your
application will compute that the event starts at 11:00 CET every Wednesday.
Which is wrong, because as the user told you, the event starts at 10:00 CET,
whatever the definition of CET is. Not at 11:00 CET. So CET means CET, not
necessarily UTC+1.

As for endpoints like REST API, a thing I daily deal with, all timestamps
should include a timezone information. It's nearly impossible to know what
timezone the timestamps are in otherwise: UTC? Server local? User local? No way
to know.

## Python design & defect

<div class="illustration pull-right">

</div>

Python comes with a timestamp object named `datetime.datetime`. It can store
date and time precise to the microsecond, and is qualified of timezone "aware"
or "unaware", whether it embeds a timezone information or not.

To build such an object based on the current time, one can use
`datetime.datetime.utcnow()` to retrieve the date and time for the UTC
timezone, and `datetime.datetime.now()` to retrieve the date and time for the
current timezone, whatever it is.

{% syntax python %}
>>> import datetime
>>> datetime.datetime.utcnow()
datetime.datetime(2015, 6, 15, 13, 24, 48, 27631)
>>> datetime.datetime.now()
datetime.datetime(2015, 6, 15, 15, 24, 52, 276161)
{% endsyntax %}

As you can notice, none of these results contains timezone information. Indeed,
Python `datetime` API always returns unaware `datetime` objects, which is very
unfortunate. Indeed, as soon as you get one of this object, there is no way to
know what the timezone is, therefore these objects are pretty "useless" on
their own.

[Armin Ronacher proposes that an application always consider that the unaware `datetime` objects from Python are considered as UTC](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2011/7/15/eppur-si-muove/).
As we just saw, that statement cannot be considered true for objects returned
by `datetime.datetime.now()`, so I would not advise doing so. `datetime`
objects with no timezone should be considered as a "bug" in the application.

## Recommendations

My recommendation list comes down to:

1. Always use aware `datetime` object, i.e. with timezone information. That
   makes sure you can compare them directly (aware and unaware `datetime`
   objects are not comparable) and will return them correctly to users.
   Leverage [pytz](http://pytz.sourceforge.net/) to have timezone objects.
2. Use [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) as input and output
   string format. Use `datetime.datetime.isoformat()` to return timestamps as string formatted
   using  that format, which includes the timezone information.

In Python, that's equivalent to having:

{% syntax python %}
>>> import datetime
>>> import pytz
>>> def utcnow():
    return datetime.datetime.now(tz=pytz.utc)
>>> utcnow()
datetime.datetime(2015, 6, 15, 14, 45, 19, 182703, tzinfo=<UTC>)
>>> utcnow().isoformat()
'2015-06-15T14:45:21.982600+00:00'
{% endsyntax %}

If you need to parse strings containing ISO 8601 formatted timestamp, you can
rely on the _[iso8601](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/iso8601)_, which returns
timestamps with correct timezone information. This makes timestamps directly
comparable:

{% syntax python %}
>>> import iso8601
>>> iso8601.parse_date(utcnow().isoformat())
datetime.datetime(2015, 6, 15, 14, 46, 43, 945813, tzinfo=<FixedOffset '+00:00' datetime.timedelta(0)>)
>>> iso8601.parse_date(utcnow().isoformat()) < utcnow()
True
{% endsyntax %}

If you need to store those timestamps, the same rule should apply. If you rely
on [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org), it assumes that all the timestamp are in UTC,
so be careful when storing them – you will have to normalize the timestamp to
UTC.

For [MySQL](http://mysql.org), nothing is assumed, it's up to the application
to insert them in a timezone that makes sense to it. Obviously, if you have
multiple applications accessing the same database with different data sources,
this can end up being a nightmare.

[PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org) has a
[special data type that is recommended](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/datatype-datetime.html)
called `timestamp with timezone`, and which can store the timezone associated,
and do all the computation for you. That's the recommended way to store them
obviously. That does not mean you should not use UTC in most cases; that just
means you are sure that the timestamp are stored in UTC since it's written in
the database, and you check if any other application inserted timestamps with
different timezone.

## OpenStack status

As a side note, I've improved OpenStack situation recently by changing the
[oslo.utils.timeutils](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/oslo.utils/api/timeutils.html)
module to deprecate some useless and dangerous functions. I've also added
support for returning timezone aware objects when using the
`oslo_utils.timeutils.utcnow()` function. It's not possible to make it a
default unfortunately for backward compatibility reason, but it's there
nevertheless, and it's advised to use it. Thanks to my colleague
[Victor](http://haypo-notes.readthedocs.org/) for the help!

Have a nice day, whatever your timezone is!
