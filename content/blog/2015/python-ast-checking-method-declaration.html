A few months ago, I wrote
[the definitive guide about Python method declaration](https://julien.danjou.info/blog/2013/guide-python-static-class-abstract-methods),
which had quite a good success. I still fight every day in
[OpenStack](http://openstack.org) to have the developers declare their methods
correctly in the patches they submit.

{% endmark %}

# Automation plan

The thing is, I really dislike doing the same things over and over again.
Furthermore, I'm not perfect either, and I miss a lot of these kind of problems
in the reviews I made. So I decided to replace me by a program – a more
scalable and less error-prone version of my brain.

In OpenStack, we rely on *[flake8](http://flake8.readthedocs.org/en/2.2.3/)* to
do static analysis of our Python code in order to spot common programming
mistakes.

But we are really pedantic, so we wrote some extra hacking rules that we
enforce on our code. To that end, we wrote a *flake8* extension called
*[hacking](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hacking)*. I really like these rules, I
even recommend to apply them in your own project. Though I might be biased or
victim of Stockholm syndrome. Your call.

Anyway, it's pretty clear that I need to add a check for method declaration in
*hacking*. Let's write a *flake8* extension!

# Typical error

The typical error I spot is the following:

{% syntax python %}
class Foo(object):
    # self is not used, the method does not need
    # to be bound, it should be declared static
    def bar(self, a, b, c):
        return a + b - c
{% endsyntax %}

That would be the correct version:

{% syntax python %}
class Foo(object):
    @staticmethod
    def bar(a, b, c):
        return a + b - c
{% endsyntax %}

This kind of mistake is not a show-stopper. It's just not optimized. Why you
have to manually declare static or class methods might be a language issue, but
I don't want to debate about Python misfeatures or design flaws.

# Strategy

We could probably use some big magical regular expression to catch this
problem. *flake8* is based on the *[pep8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8)*
tool, which can do a line by line analysis of the code. But this method would
make it very hard and error prone to detect this pattern.

Though it's also possible to do an <acronym title="Abstract Syntax
Tree">AST</acronym> based analysis on on a per-file basis with *pep8*. So
that's the method I pick as it's the most solid.

# AST analysis

I won't dive deeply into Python AST and how it works. You can find plenty of
sources on the Internet, and I even talk about it a bit in my book
*[The Hacker's Guide to Python](https://julien.danjou.info/books/the-hacker-guide-to-python)*.

To check correctly if all the methods in a Python file are correctly declared,
we need to do the following:

* Iterate over all the statement node of the AST
* Check that the statement is a class definition (`ast.ClassDef`)
* Iterate over all the function definitions (`ast.FunctionDef`) of that class
  statement to check if it is already declared with `@staticmethod` or not
* If the method is not declared static, we need to check if the first argument
  (`self`) is used somewhere in the method

# *Flake8* plugin

In order to register a new plugin in *flake8* via *hacking*, we just need to
add an entry in `setup.cfg`:

{% syntax %}
[entry_points]
flake8.extension =
    […]
    H904 = hacking.checks.other:StaticmethodChecker
    H905 = hacking.checks.other:StaticmethodChecker
{% endsyntax %}

We register 2 *hacking* codes here. As you will notice later, we are actually
going to add an extra check in our code for the same price. Stay tuned.

The next step is to write the actual plugin. Since we are using an AST based
check, the plugin needs to be a class following a certain signature:

{% syntax python %}
@core.flake8ext
class StaticmethodChecker(object):
    def __init__(self, tree, filename):
        self.tree = tree

    def run(self):
        pass
{% endsyntax %}

So far, so good and pretty easy. We store the tree locally, then we just need
to use it in `run()` and `yield` the problem we discover following `pep8`
expected signature, which is a tuple of `(lineno, col_offset, error_string,
code)`.

# This AST is made for walking ♪ ♬ ♩

The `ast` module provides the `walk` function, that allow to iterate easily on
a tree. We'll use that to run through the AST. First, let's write a loop that
ignores the statement that are not class definition.

{% syntax python %}
@core.flake8ext
class StaticmethodChecker(object):
    def __init__(self, tree, filename):
        self.tree = tree

    def run(self):
        for stmt in ast.walk(self.tree):
            # Ignore non-class
            if not isinstance(stmt, ast.ClassDef):
                continue
{% endsyntax %}

We still don't check for anything, but we know how to ignore statement that are
not class definitions. The next step need to be to ignore what is not function
definition. We just iterate over the attributes of the class definition.

{% syntax python %}
for stmt in ast.walk(self.tree):
    # Ignore non-class
    if not isinstance(stmt, ast.ClassDef):
        continue
    # If it's a class, iterate over its body member to find methods
    for body_item in stmt.body:
        # Not a method, skip
        if not isinstance(body_item, ast.FunctionDef):
            continue
{% endsyntax %}

We're all set for checking the method, which is `body_item`. First, we need to
check if it's already declared as static. If so, we don't have to do any
further check and we can bail out.

{% syntax python %}
for stmt in ast.walk(self.tree):
    # Ignore non-class
    if not isinstance(stmt, ast.ClassDef):
        continue
    # If it's a class, iterate over its body member to find methods
    for body_item in stmt.body:
        # Not a method, skip
        if not isinstance(body_item, ast.FunctionDef):
            continue
        # Check that it has a decorator
        for decorator in body_item.decorator_list:
            if (isinstance(decorator, ast.Name)
               and decorator.id == 'staticmethod'):
                # It's a static function, it's OK
                break
        else:
            # Function is not static, we do nothing for now
            pass
{% endsyntax %}

Note that we use the special `for/else` form of Python, where the `else` is
evaluated unless we used `break` to exit the `for` loop.

{% syntax python %}
for stmt in ast.walk(self.tree):
    # Ignore non-class
    if not isinstance(stmt, ast.ClassDef):
        continue
    # If it's a class, iterate over its body member to find methods
    for body_item in stmt.body:
        # Not a method, skip
        if not isinstance(body_item, ast.FunctionDef):
            continue
        # Check that it has a decorator
        for decorator in body_item.decorator_list:
            if (isinstance(decorator, ast.Name)
               and decorator.id == 'staticmethod'):
                # It's a static function, it's OK
                break
        else:
            try:
                first_arg = body_item.args.args[0]
            except IndexError:
                yield (
                    body_item.lineno,
                    body_item.col_offset,
                    "H905: method misses first argument",
                    "H905",
                )
                # Check next method
                continue
{% endsyntax %}

We finally added some check! We grab the first argument from the method
signature. Unless it fails, and in that case, we know there's a problem: you
can't have a bound method without the `self` argument, therefore we raise the
`H905` code to signal a method that misses its first argument.

Now you know why we registered this second `pep8` code along with `H904` in
`setup.cfg`. We have here a good opportunity to kill two birds with one stone.

The next step is to check if that first argument is used in the code of the
method.

{% syntax python %}
for stmt in ast.walk(self.tree):
    # Ignore non-class
    if not isinstance(stmt, ast.ClassDef):
        continue
    # If it's a class, iterate over its body member to find methods
    for body_item in stmt.body:
        # Not a method, skip
        if not isinstance(body_item, ast.FunctionDef):
            continue
        # Check that it has a decorator
        for decorator in body_item.decorator_list:
            if (isinstance(decorator, ast.Name)
               and decorator.id == 'staticmethod'):
                # It's a static function, it's OK
                break
        else:
            try:
                first_arg = body_item.args.args[0]
            except IndexError:
                yield (
                    body_item.lineno,
                    body_item.col_offset,
                    "H905: method misses first argument",
                    "H905",
                )
                # Check next method
                continue
            for func_stmt in ast.walk(body_item):
                if six.PY3:
                    if (isinstance(func_stmt, ast.Name)
                       and first_arg.arg == func_stmt.id):
                        # The first argument is used, it's OK
                        break
                else:
                    if (func_stmt != first_arg
                       and isinstance(func_stmt, ast.Name)
                       and func_stmt.id == first_arg.id):
                        # The first argument is used, it's OK
                        break
            else:
                yield (
                    body_item.lineno,
                    body_item.col_offset,
                    "H904: method should be declared static",
                    "H904",
                )
{% endsyntax %}

To that end, we iterate using `ast.walk` again and we look for the use of the
same variable named (usually `self`, but if could be anything, like `cls` for
`@classmethod`) in the body of the function. If not found, we finally yield the
`H904` error code. Otherwise, we're good.

# Conclusion

I've
[submitted this patch to *hacking*](https://review.openstack.org/#/c/151952/),
and, finger crossed, it might be merged one day. If it's not I'll create a new
Python package with that check for flake8. The actual submitted code is a bit
more complex to take into account the use of
[`abc`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/abc.html) module and include some
tests.

As you may have notice, the code walks over the module AST definition several
times. There might be a couple of optimization to browse the AST in only one
pass, but I'm not sure it's worth it considering the actual usage of the tool.
I'll let that as an exercise for the reader interested in contributing to
OpenStack. 😉

Happy hacking!
