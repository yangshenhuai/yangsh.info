Finally, [Gnocchi 1.3.0](https://launchpad.net/gnocchi/trunk/1.3.0) is out.
This is our final release, more or less matching the OpenStack 6 months
schedule, that concludes the Liberty development cycle.

This release was supposed to be released a few weeks earlier, but our
integration test got completely blocked for several days just the week before
the OpenStack Mitaka summit.

# New website

We build a new dedicated website for Gnocchi at
[gnocchi.xyz](http://gnocchi.xyz). We want to promote Gnocchi outside of the
[OpenStack](http://openstack.org) bubble, as it a useful timeseries database on
its own that can work without the rest of the stack. We'll try to improve the
documentation. If you're curious, feel free to check it out and report anything
you miss!

# The speed bump

Obviously, if it was a bug in Gnocchi that we have hit, it would have been
quick to fix. However, we found
[a nasty bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/python-keystoneclient/+bug/1508424) in
Swift caused by the evil monkey-patching of Eventlet (once again) blended with
a mixed usage of native threads and Eventlet threads in Swift. Shake all of
that, and you got yourself pretty race conditions when using the Keystone
middleware authentication.

In the meantime, we disabled Swift multi-threading by using mod_wsgi instead of
Eventlet in devstack.

# New features

So what's new in this new shiny release? A few interesting things:

- Metric deletion is now asynchronous. That's not the most used feature in the
  REST API – weirdly people do not often delete metrics – but it's now way
  faster and reliable by being asynchronous. _Metricd_ is now in charge of
  cleaning up things up.

- Speed improvement. We are now confident to be even more faster than in the
  [latest benchmarks I run](gnocchi-benchmarks) (around 1.5-2× faster), which
  makes Gnocchi *really* fast with its native storage back-ends. We profiled
  and optimized Carbonara and the REST API data validation.

- Improve _metricd_ status report. It now reports the size of the backlog of
  the whole cluster both in its log and via the REST API. Easy monitoring!

- Ceph drivers enhancement. We had people testing the Ceph drivers in
  production, so we made a few changes and fixes to it to make it more solid.

And that's all we did in the last couple of months. We have a lot of things on
the roadmap that are pretty exciting, and I'll sure talk about them in the next
weeks.
