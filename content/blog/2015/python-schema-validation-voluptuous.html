Continuing my post series on the tools I use these days in Python, this time I
would like to talk about a library I really like, named
_[voluptuous](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/voluptuous)_.

It's no secret that most of the time, when a program receives data from the
outside, it's a big deal to handle it. Indeed, most of the time your program
has no guarantee that the stream is valid and that it contains what is
expected.

The [robustness principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle)
says you should be liberal in what you accept, though
[that is not always a good idea](http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2011/8/114933-the-robustness-principle-reconsidered/fulltext)
neither. Whatever policy you chose, you need to process those data and
implement a policy that will work – lax or not.

That means that the program need to look into the data received, check that it
finds everything it needs, complete what might be missing (e.g. set some
default), transform some data, and maybe reject those data in the end.

## Data validation

The first step is to validate the data, which means checking all the fields are
there and all the types are right or understandable (parseable). _Voluptuous_
provides a single interface for all that called a `Schema`.

{% syntax python %}
>>> from voluptuous import Schema
>>> s = Schema({
...   'q': str,
...   'per_page': int,
...   'page': int,
... })
>>> s({"q": "hello"})
{'q': 'hello'}
>>> s({"q": "hello", "page": "world"})
voluptuous.MultipleInvalid: expected int for dictionary value @ data['page']
>>> s({"q": "hello", "unknown": "key"})
voluptuous.MultipleInvalid: extra keys not allowed @ data['unknown']
{% endsyntax %}

The argument to `voluptuous.Schema` should be the data structure that you
expect. _Voluptuous_ accepts any kind of data structure, so it could also be a
simple string or an array of dict of array of integer. You get it.
Here it's a `dict` with a few keys that if present should be validated as
certain types. By default, _Voluptuous_ does not raise an error if some keys
are missing. However, it is invalid to have extra keys in a dict by default. If
you want to allow extra keys, it is possible to specify it.

{% syntax python %}
>>> from voluptuous import Schema
>>> s = Schema({"foo": str}, extra=True)
>>> s({"bar": 2})
{"bar": 2}
{% endsyntax %}

It is also possible to make some keys mandatory.

{% syntax python %}
>>> from voluptuous import Schema, Required
>>> s = Schema({Required("foo"): str})
>>> s({})
voluptuous.MultipleInvalid: required key not provided @ data['foo']
{% endsyntax %}

You can create custom data type very easily. _Voluptuous_ data types are
actually just functions that are called with one argument, the value, and that
should either return the value or raise an `Invalid` or `ValueError` exception.

{% syntax python %}
>>> from voluptuous import Schema, Invalid
>>> def StringWithLength5(value):
...     if isinstance(value, str) and len(value) == 5:
...             return value
...     raise Invalid("Not a string with 5 chars")
...
>>> s = Schema(StringWithLength5)
>>> s("hello")
'hello'
>>> s("hello world")
voluptuous.MultipleInvalid: Not a string with 5 chars
{% endsyntax %}

Most of the time though, there is no need to create your own data types.
_Voluptuous_ provides logical operators that can, combined with a few others
provided primitives such as `voluptuous.Length` or `voluptuous.Range`, create a
large range of validation scheme.

{% syntax python %}
>>> from voluptuous import Schema, Length, All
>>> s = Schema(All(str, Length(min=3, max=5)))
>>> s("hello")
"hello"
>>> s("hello world")
voluptuous.MultipleInvalid: length of value must be at most 5
{% endsyntax %}

The [voluptuous documentation](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/voluptuous) has a
good set of examples that you can check to have a good overview of what you can
do.

## Data transformation

<div class="illustration pull-right icon">
  <img src="/media/images/blog/2015/document-validation.png">
</div>

What's important to remember, is that each data type that you use is a function
that is called and returns a value, if the value is considered valid. That
value returned is what is actually used and returned after the schema
validation:

{% syntax python %}
>>> import uuid
>>> from voluptuous import Schema
>>> def UUID(value):
...     return uuid.UUID(value)
...
>>> s = Schema({"foo": UUID})
>>> data_converted = s({"foo": "uuid?"})
voluptuous.MultipleInvalid: not a valid value for dictionary value @ data['foo']
>>> data_converted = s({"foo": "8B7BA51C-DFF5-45DD-B28C-6911A2317D1D"})
>>> data_converted
{'foo': UUID('8b7ba51c-dff5-45dd-b28c-6911a2317d1d')}
{% endsyntax %}

By defining a custom `UUID` function that converts a value to a UUID, the
schema converts the string passed in the data to a Python UUID object –
validating the format at the same time.

Note a little trick here: it's not possible to use directly `uuid.UUID` in the
schema, otherwise _Voluptuous_ would check that the data is actually an
instance of `uuid.UUID`:

{% syntax python %}
>>> from voluptuous import Schema
>>> s = Schema({"foo": uuid.UUID})
>>> s({"foo": "8B7BA51C-DFF5-45DD-B28C-6911A2317D1D"})
voluptuous.MultipleInvalid: expected UUID for dictionary value @ data['foo']
>>> s({"foo": uuid.uuid4()})
{'foo': UUID('60b6d6c4-e719-47a7-8e2e-b4a4a30631ed')}
{% endsyntax %}

And that's not what is wanted here.

That mechanism is really neat to transform, for example, strings to timestamps.

{% syntax python %}
>>> import datetime
>>> from voluptuous import Schema
>>> def Timestamp(value):
...     return datetime.datetime.strptime(value, "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S")
...
>>> s = Schema({"foo": Timestamp})
>>> s({"foo": '2015-03-03T12:12:12'})
{'foo': datetime.datetime(2015, 3, 3, 12, 12, 12)}
>>> s({"foo": '2015-03-03T12:12'})
voluptuous.MultipleInvalid: not a valid value for dictionary value @ data['foo']
{% endsyntax %}

## Recursive schemas

So far, _Voluptuous_ has one limitation so far: the ability to have recursive
schemas. The simplest way to circumvent it is by using another function as an
indirection.

{% syntax python %}
>>> from voluptuous import Schema, Any
>>> def _MySchema(value):
...     return MySchema(value)
...
>>> from voluptuous import Any
>>> MySchema = Schema({"foo": Any("bar", _MySchema)})
>>> MySchema({"foo": {"foo": "bar"}})
{'foo': {'foo': 'bar'}}
>>> MySchema({"foo": {"foo": "baz"}})
voluptuous.MultipleInvalid: not a valid value for dictionary value @ data['foo']['foo']
{% endsyntax %}

## Usage in REST API

<div class="illustration pull-right icon">
  <img src="/media/images/blog/2015/cloud-api.png">
</div>

I started to use _Voluptuous_ to validate data in a the REST API provided by
[Gnocchi](http://launchpad.net/gnocchi). So far it has been a really good tool,
and we've been able to
[create a complete REST API](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/gnocchi/rest.html)
that is very easy to validate on the server side. I would definitely recommend
it for that. It blends with any Web framework easily.

One of the upside compared to solution like
[JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/), is the ability to create or re-use your
own custom data types while converting values at validation time. It is also
very Pythonic, and extensible – it's pretty great to use for all of that. It's
also not tied to any serialization format.

On the other hand, JSON Schema is language agnostic and is serializable itself
as JSON. That makes it easy to be exported and provided to a consumer so it can
understand the API and validate the data potentially on its side.
