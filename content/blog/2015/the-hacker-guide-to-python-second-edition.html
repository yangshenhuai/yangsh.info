A year passed since the
[first release of The Hacker's Guide to Python](/blog/2014/the-hacker-guide-to-python-has-been-released)
in March 2014. A few hundreds copies have been distributed so far, and the
feedback is wonderful!

I already wrote extensively about the
[making of that book](/blog/2014/making-of-the-hacker-guide-to-python) last
year, and I cannot emphasize enough how this adventure has been amazing so far.
That's why I decided a few months ago to update the guide and add some new
content.

So let's talk about what's new in this second edition of the book!

First, I obviously fixed a few things. I had some reports about small mistakes
and typos which I applied as I received them. Not a lot fortunately, but it's
still better to have fewer errors in a book, right?

Then, I updated some of the content. Things changed since I wrote the first
chapters of that guide 18 months ago. Therefore I had to rewrite some of the
sections and take into account new software or libraries that were released.

At last, I decided to enhance the book with one more interview. I've requested
my fellow OpenStack developer [Joshua Harlow](https://github.com/harlowja), who
is leading a few interesting Python projects, to join the long list of
interviewees in the book. I hope you'll enjoy it!
